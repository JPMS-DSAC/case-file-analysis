was also effected only to recover the pending dues.","603":"The pledge was also invoked only because without doing so it was No possible to sell the shares which were pledged.","604":"There was no

the fact that neither had it access to any unpublished price sensitive information relating to NOCIL No was it anyway connected with NOCIL or its management.","609":"The company had to invoke the pledge and sell the shares only in the interest of protecting its investments and thereby its large body of shareholders.","612":"Further regulation 13 3 was applicable about changes in the holdings since the earlier disclosure which was No necessary in the instant case.","619":"It stated that disclosure under Regulation 7 1 of the SAST Regulations was No required to be made at the time of creation of the pledge i.e  during 19992001 as the term \u2018acquirer\u2019 did No include the \u2018pledgee\u2019 then.","620":"Further Regulation 13 1 of the Insider Trading Regulations was No in existence at the time of creation of the pledge and disclosure under Regulation 13 1 was obviously No required to be made then.","622":"Similarly Regulation 13 1 of the Insider Trading Regulations did No make a mention that invocation of pledge was covered under the term \u2018acquisition of shares\u2019.","623":"For this reason no disclosure was required to be made then.","626":"Thus the concept of invocation of pledge had been brought in as an event for making disclosures for the first time then.","627":"Similar provisions did No exist in 2004 when the invocation of pledge took place in its
