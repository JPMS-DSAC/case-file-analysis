shares of  Mr Akshay Pravin Sanghavi which it received through offmarket from him.","57":"As detailed above the way the Noticee had traded in the scrip of ICL by increasing the price of the scrip by executing transactions No only manipulated the price of the scrip but also created artificial volume in the scrip of ICL.","58":"This led to misleading appearance of trading interest in the scrip of

said projects.","165":"Further I have noted from the documents on record that the letter towards their getting of project subject to their compliance with certain conditions was issued to the Company

that was held on August 20 2009 the shareholders were informed that the Company had orders of about 1000 crore on hand.","197":"Further I have perused the copy of corresponding speech of the Chairman made before the shareholders of the Company in the AGM on August 20 2009 and observed that there is no mention of the Arunachal Pradesh Project.","198":"That means that the investors shareholders and public at large came to know about the Company bagging the project only after the corporate announcement was made by VEL in this regard on August 28 2009.","199":"The Noticee has stated that if they  Mr Anil Harish and the Noticee wished to take advantage of the unpublished price sensitive information then they would have purchased the shares immediately after the Board meeting on July 31 2009 rather than to wait for three weeks until after the AGM.","204":"In this regard I had advised the Noticee at the time of personal hearing to furnish all sale purchases made by her and  Mr Anil Harish

purchases with effect from August 21 2009 and major chunk of the purchases i.e  purchase of 79 378 shares were made by him just prior to the corporate announcement made by the Company regarding its bagging of said project worth 172 crore from the Government of Arunachal Pradesh on August 28 2009 at 64845 p.m. His entire purchase of 79378 shares made in the year 2009 were just prior to the

purchased shares at an average cost of 121.83 per share and the present market price is about 97.00 per share which means that she has actually incurred loss.","222":"Despite that the Noticee and her son the Chairman of the Company purchased the shares before the information was disseminated to public.","225":"I have noted that after August 28 2009 neither of them had purchased any VEL shares for the next four months.","226":"The said purchase of 79 378 shares by  Mr Anil Harish and 19201 shares by the Noticee made immediately prior to August 28 2009 are the only purchases made by them during the entire 2009.","230":"In this regard I have observed that after making of public announcement there was no significant rise in the price of the shares of the Company.","231":"It had moved almost in

of the Company as has been detailed in the table at para No 20 above do indicate that during the last week of August 2009 its price had moved almost in tandem with the BSE Sensex and the corporate disclosure made by the Company on August 28 2009 regarding its getting orders worth 172 crore from the Government of Arunachal Pradesh had no significant impact on the price of the scrip.","241":"The Noticee being an insider as she was mother of the Chairman of the Company and as has been discussed above was in possession of some unpublished price sensitive information and she along with her son who were earlier No holding any shares of the Company made purchases during August 21 2009 to August 28 2009 in large numbers.","242":"The average price of the shares purchased by the Noticee up to
