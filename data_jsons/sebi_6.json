of Parag K Ajmera in the matter of MCX days and impending payment defaults by the members of NSEL and loss of reputation of Promoters and Management of MCX.","828":"It was observed that any news

there was a specific finding with regard to the periodicity of the UPSI which is as under \u201c25.","864":"In this regard it is noted that on October 3 2012 an article appeared in the Economic Times a widely distributed financial newspaper which contained information relating to the issuance of SCN dated April 27 2012 to NSEL majority of the contents of the SCN allegations against NSEL with regard to violation of conditions of DCA notification dated June 5 2007 and the gist of NSEL\u2019s reply to the SCN.","865":"The article also covered the possible action that could be taken by DCA

explanation to the allegations levelled in the SCN would result in withdrawal of exemption granted to NSEL vide notification dated June 5 2007.","876":"The said withdrawal of exemption in turn would have had a cascading effect on the contracts being traded on NSEL payment defaults in relation thereto and the eventual loss to the reputation of the promoters management of NSEL.","900":"The Noticee
