Anil Harish has further stated that the final work order was received by the Company from the Government of Arunachal Pradesh on August 24 2009 and hence it cannot be alleged that he was aware about the Company bagging the order on July 31 2009.","170":"In this regard instead of relying on the assumptions I would like to discuss the attending circumstances of the case before arriving at the conclusion that whether the said information was available with the Company prior to its Board meeting on July 31 2009.","171":"In the matter I would like to reproduce the point No 20 of the minutes of the said meeting which reads as under \u2013 AUTHORITY TO MR.","172":"SURESH MANSATA TO SIGN AND EXECUTE CONTRACT AT ARUNACHAL PRADESH \u201cRESOLVED THAT  Mr Suresh Mansata Commercial Manager of the Company be and is hereby authorized to execute and sign the Contract Agreement and bank guarantees for the project of Arunachal Pradesh for \u201cTwo laning of NH153 from km 24 00 to 40 00 under SARDPNE Phase A and Reconstruction Widening to 2 Lane of NH153 from km.","174":"The mere fact that in the said meeting the Commercial Manager of the Company was authorized to execute and sign the Contract Agreement and bank guarantees for specific projects in the State of Arunachal Pradesh indicate that the Company was aware of the acceptance of its proposal bid by the Government of Arunachal Pradesh and that the said projects have been awarded to it subject to fulfillment of certain conditions otherwise the question of authorizing its official to execute Contract Agreement etc. for the said purpose would No have arisen.","175":"And since  Mr Anil Harish was the Chairman of the Company and had presided over the said Board meeting his above contention that the matter regarding the said project was No discussed at the board meeting and that he was No aware of the said acceptance cannot sustain.","176":"Now the question arises that such letter of acceptance dated July 31 2009 intimating the Company that they have been awarded the contract for the project was subject to compIiance of certain conditions by the Company and it did No confirm that the Company has bagged the Order.","177":"Mr Anil Harish has stated that on their complying with the conditions the final work order was issued by the Government of Arunachal Pradesh on August 22 2009 which was received by the Company on August 24 2009.","180":"I have observed that on both the said letters date is appearing at two places.","181":"At both the places the date is appearing as \u201cDated Jairampur the th August 09 \u201d which means that at both the places in the copy of said two letters made available to me only the month and year is visible but No the day on which it was issued.","182":"In both the said letters date is mentioned by the person signing the letter as 22 08 09 below his signature but in both the letters there is overwriting which suggests that some other number in the date was initially mentioned and has subsequently been changed as 22.","184":"Further the said letters do No bear the inward stamp of the Company indicating that it was received as claimed by  Mr Anil Harish on August 24 2009.","186":"Even if the plea of  Mr Anil Harish is accepted that the letter was received by the Company on August 24 2009 it do No absolve the Noticee of the charges as most of the alleged purchases were made by the Noticee and  Mr Anil Harish on 25th and 28th August 2009 i.e  before the price sensitive corporate announcement was made by the Company on August 28 2009.","189":"In regard to the said purchases the Noticee has stated that the Indian economy was doing well and particularly since infrastructure was being emphasized by the Government she felt that the Company had a good longterm future and therefore decided to invest in the shares of the Company.","190":"But all the investments were made after the date of AGM i.e  August 20 2009 and further that in the said AGM of the Company that was held on August 20 2009 the shareholders were informed that the Company had orders of about 1000 crore on hand.","191":"No coming to the said submissions of the Noticee the fact that the Indian economy is doing well and infrastructure was being emphasized by the Government was No a new development or incidence that occurred around August 21 2009.","192":"The said fact regarding the Indian economy and the emphasis of the Government on infrastructure was known much prior to the period when the Noticee and her son started purchasing the shares of the Company.","194":"The said purchases by the Noticee and her son just few days prior to the Company making corporate announcement regarding its getting of projects from the Government of Arunachal Pradesh become more suspicious on the count that earlier they were No holding any shares of the Company and in last so many years they had No purchased even a single share of the Company.","200":"On this issue I have noted from the submissions of  Mr Anil Harish dated August 27 2011 which have been relied upon by the Notice that the letter dated July 31 2009 of the Government of Arunachal Pradesh was only a \u201cLetter of Acceptance\u201d and getting of final Work Order was subject to compliance of certain conditions.","203":"The Noticee has also stated that the purchases made by them as referred to in the SCN are No the only purchases but there are other purchases also which have No been alleged to be motivated by possession of some unpublished price sensitive information just because the investigating authority of SEBI could No find any corporate announcement made by VEL in the proximity of date of such purchases.","207":"In January 2010 he purchased a few shares 144 shares and then again after a gap of around four months he purchased some more shares towards end of April 2010. ii Ratna Harish  the Noticee  Date of Purchase No of shares Rate per share in  25.08.2009 9201 87.27 28.08.2009 10000 76.00 04.01.2010 789 109.95 15.04.2010 10000 198.69 Total  29990 It is evident from the above that just like  Mr Anil Harish the Noticee was also No holding any shares of the Company earlier but all of a sudden she started making purchases with effect from August 25 2009 and major purchases i.e  purchase of 19 201 shares were made by her prior to the public announcement made by the Company on August 28 2009.","210":"August 25 2009 and August 28 2009 and in my opinion it cannot be just a matter of coincidence that two related persons who had earlier No purchased any shares of the Company would all of a sudden start purchasing shares on the same dates independently and on their own without any prior understanding or meeting of minds.","211":"The Noticee has further submitted that she has No made any unlawful gains as even after more than two years of the first purchase made by her she has No sold the shares and those are still in her possession.","213":"Had her intention been to make gains out of unpublished price sensitive information instead of keep on buying shares at higher prices she would have sold the shares.","214":"The purchases had been made by her with full disclosures in a legitimate way and were No made to make gain or any unfair advantage.","220":"First the corporate announcement made by the Company regarding its bagging of projects worth 172 crore was a significant corporate development and therefore it was indeed a price sensitive information in terms of regulation 2haiv of the PIT Regulations which was disseminated by the Company to the public on the evening of August 28 2009.","221":"Secondly even if it is presumed that as stated by the Noticee the said confirmation from the Government of Arunachal Pradesh was received by the Company on August 24 2009 then in that case in terms of regulation 3 i of the PIT Regulations the Noticee being an insider as per regulation 2e r w regulation 2h of the PIT Regulations  was No supposed to deal in the shares till the information was published in the instant case till August 28 2009.","228":"It is No so that prior to August 2009 or after August 2009 there was significant variance in the general economic scenario or the policy of the Government on the infrastructure development which prompted her No to buy any shares during those periods.","229":"No coming to the contention of the Noticee that she had only purchased the shares and No sold any shares and had her intention been to take undue advantage then she would have disposed of the shares immediately after the prices would have gone up.","240":"There is no dispute over the issue that the aforesaid announcement by the Company was indeed a price sensitive information and furthermore in these type of circumstances it is the intent of the person buying or dealing in shares that is more important rather than the impact of any price sensitive information on the price of the scrip.","244":"During the said period the Noticee being in possession of the price sensitive information was prohibited under law [regulation 3 i of the PIT Regulations] to deal in the shares of the Company.","279":"Accordingly the applicant vide his email dated March 30 2020 informed about the payment of \u20b9664063  Rupees Six Lakh SixtyFour Thousand and SixtyThree only from his ICICI Bank Account towards the settlement charges.","280":"The concerned department of SEBI vide email dated April 08 2020 has confirmed the receiving of the penalty amount.","281":"No therefore in view of the acceptance of the settlement terms and receipt of penalty amount as above by SEBI the instant adjudication proceedings initiated against the applicant vide SCN dated June 04 2019 are disposed of in terms of section 15JB of the SEBI Act 1992 read with regulation 231 of the Settlement Regulations on the basis of the settlement terms.","296":"It was alleged in the SCN that Noticee has failed to make disclosure regarding sale of more than 2% of the share capital of BBIL to BBIL and to stock exchanges within 2 days of transaction and thereby violated Regulation 71A read with regulation 72 of the SAST Regulations 1997.","299":"The Noticee\u2019s main submissions in respect of the charges in the SCN are given as under  \u2022 Noticee is a promoter group company which had sold 489843 shares of BBIL representing 3.23% of share capital of BBIL to Mrs. Indu Arya who is also part of the promoter group on 28.03.2006 and the said transaction was inter se transfer between promoters.","300":"Further as a result of this transaction there was no change in the overall promoter shareholding in the shareholding pattern of BBIL.","301":"\u2022 Noticee made the requisite disclosures as stipulated under Regulation 13 3 of SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 PIT Regulations on the date of sale itself and Adjudication Order in the matter of Blue Blends India Limited notice never had any intention to conceal any transaction from the investors.","302":"A copy of the disclosures made under PIT Regulations was also enclosed.","303":"\u2022 Mrs Indu Arya who was also part of the promoter group have made requisite disclosures under SAST Regulations 1997.","305":"\u2022 Trading in the shares of BBIL were placed under suspension from 10th September 2001 to 2nd December 2012 and the suspension was revoked only on 3rd December 2012.","306":"The above mentioned transaction also took place during the period when the scrip was under suspension and hence there was no intention of promoters to derive any undue benefit by No disclosing the said transaction under SAST Regulations 1997.","307":"\u2022 As both the entities belonged to promoter group of BBIL this being inter se transfer between promoters and one of the entities who was part of the promoter group has already made the requisite disclosures and the trading in the scrip was also placed under suspension we are of the opinion that disclosure on our part under SAST Regulations 1997 is No required as it will No materially make any difference to the price of the scrip as the information was already in public domain and trading in the scrip was already suspended.","308":"Adjudication Order in the matter of Blue Blends India Limited \u2022 Mrs Indu Arya was one of the acquirers in the open offer made by all the Acquirers in terms of SAST Regulations 2011 to the equity shareholders other than promoters of BBIL through public announcement dated July 25 2012.","309":"The above disclosures regarding No compliance of SAST Regulations 1997 by the Noticee were disclosed voluntarily by the acquirers vide the draft letter of offer filed by the acquirers.","310":"\u2022 We submit and reiterate that none of the promoters of BBIL have had any intention to hide and conceal the information and the acquirers only brought this No compliance to the notice of SEBI when they filed the offer document for open offer.","311":"Hence the Noticee did No have any intention to hide No did it hide any information from general investors as the transaction already came in public domain on the same day itself albeit under separate regulation of SEBI and No SAST Regulations 1997 for which the notice has been issued.","312":"\u2022 The networth of BBIL has eroded much prior to the date of transaction carried out by us and the intrinsic value of the share of BBIL was negative at that point in time and that BBIL was declared a sick company and had filed a scheme of reconstruction with BIFR way back in 2002.","313":"\u2022 Neither notice had any unfair gain or advantage No any loss or harm was caused to the investors with No reporting of said information as information regarding sale was already disclosed by notice under PIT Regulations and information regarding purchase was reported by Mrs Indu Arya.","314":"Adjudication Order in the matter of Blue Blends India Limited \u2022 Provisions of Regulation 71A of SAST Regulations 1997 and regulation 133 of PIT Regulations are No substantially different since violation of first automatically triggers violation of second and hence a lenient view may be taken as regards imposition of penalty and penalty may No be imposed.","317":"The same has been held by Hon\u2019ble SAT in a similar and identical case of \u201cVitro Commodities Pvt Ltd.\u201d order of which was passed on 4.9.2013. \u2022 The Noticee has always followed all the procedures as stipulated by any regulatory authority follow all rules regulations instructions etc. issued by any government agency and our intention has always been to comply with rules regulations filings etc. and No to conceal any information.","318":"Noticee has never been penalized by any regulatory authority and have got clean track record till date.","319":"\u2022 In view of the above circumstances and as we neither have any intention to conceal information No we concealed any information no unfair gain or advantage has occurred to Noticee and also no harm or loss has been caused to retail investors the trading in the scrip was under suspension and principles laid down by Hon\u2019ble SAT in the order of \u201cVitro Commodities Pvt Ltd your goodself is kindly requested to take a lenient view in the matter and penalty stipulated under Section 15 Ab of SEBI Act 1992 may No be imposed.","345":"However Noticee has contended that the said transaction was inter se transfer between promoters and as a result of this transaction there was no change in the overall promoter shareholding in the shareholding pattern of BBIL.","354":"Noticee further contended that and since the acquirer of the shares Mrs. Indu Arya did make the requisite disclosure under SAST regulations 1997 the disclosure on part of the Noticee under SAST Regulations 1997 was No required as it will No materially make any difference to the price of the scrip as the information was already in public domain.","360":"In this context I would also like to rely on observation of Honble SAT in Premchand Shah and Others V. SEBI dated February 21 2011 wherein it was held that \u2026\u2026.","364":"However the reliance placed by the Noticee on the aforementioned case does No support its case as in the referred case the nondisclosure by the appellant occurred mostly by No as active action by appellant but as a result of bonus shares shares allotted due to amalgamation and again by issue of bonus shares.","389":"It was alleged in the SCN that the Noticee was holding 80000 shares of EIL for the quarter ended September 2014.","392":"However it was alleged that she had failed to do so.","412":"Big Bazar 150 Feet

Acharya.","551":"Anita Narayan is my wife and Leelavati Acharya is my sister.","552":"In so far as transfer of shares by Anita Narayan to me is concerned the same was in the ordinary course.","553":"Further it may be noted that Leelavati Arcahrya is financially independent and she trades independently.","554":"Insofar as common email id mobile number and address with Leelavati

surmised that I have relationship with the aforesaid individuals which is legally untenable and unsustainable.","556":"I submit that nothing has been brought on record to substantiate that any of the

any of the said persons. i Insofar as off market transfer with Hinal Mistry on October 12 2014 is concerned it is submitted that the same was in context of a loan repayment wherein I had borrowed an amount of Rs 300000  approx from the husband of Hinal Mistry i.e   Mr Lokesh Mistry on January 2014 and as repayment I had transferred shares of ASCL to Hinal Mistry based on the instructions of Lokesh Misrty.","561":"In any event the said off market transaction in October 2014 had nothing to do with the alleged trading done by them in the scrip of ASCL in April 2015 i.e  after 6 months from

happened under specific context no adverse inferences qua me can be drawn. j It is submitted that the serious and grave allegations of indulging in fraudulent manipulative and unfair trade practices as levelled in the SCN flowing from the concoction of alleged \u201cgroup of suspected entities\u201d are totally unfounded and contrary to factual position on record.","564":"Adjudication Order against Narayan Acharya in the matter of Alexander Stamps and Coin Limited Page 10 | 27 k The allegation that I had traded with the other group of suspected entities is totally incorrect.","565":"I had sold shares in the ordinary course without being aware of the counter party buyers.","566":"Some of the \u2018persons belonging to group of suspected entities\u2019 being counter parties in some of my sale trades only Vaishali Pandya is just happenstance and No something intentional. l From the perusal of Trade log it is evident that Vaishali Pandya was one of the major traders in the scrip during the investigation period.","567":"Therefore probability of her trades matching with other parties including me would be higher and in that context if my few trades have partly matched with Vaishali\u2019s trade it cannot be alleged that I had executed trades with positive LTP with Vaishali. m Very few shares mere 2210 shares qua my sales of 29524 shares have been traded between me and Vaishali Pandya.","569":"Out of the 108 counter parties to my trades only one of the party i.e  Vaishali Pandya is part of the alleged suspected entities.","570":"I categorically submit that I do No have any link nexus relationship connection dealing with Vaishali Pandya.","571":"Thus the allegation that I have traded with the \u2018persons belonging to group of suspected entities\u2019 is totally belied by the trading data itself. o I have only sold the shares during the relevant period.","572":"Further all the sales were delivery based sales.","573":"As a seller one would always like to get the maximum price for his shares.","575":"Alternatively if a buyer has already put the buy price at a price higher than the LTP and thereafter the seller puts the sell order at that price seller cannot again be accused of increasing the price. p SEBI has cherry picked only those trades wherein counter party to my transactions is Vaishali Pandya in order to draw adverse inferences against me.","576":"There are trades which have been executed above LTP but SEBI has No Adjudication Order against Narayan Acharya in the matter of Alexander Stamps and Coin Limited Page 11 | 27 found anything wrong with them because it appears counter party to such trades is No Vaishali Pandya. q On 11.03.3015 12.03.2015 and on 19.05.2015 I had traded in the shares of ASCL wherein I had sold 23000 shares of ASCL.","577":"On the said days Vaishali Pandya was also trading in the shares of ASCL and few of our trades had matched.","578":"However qua the said matched trades there is no allegation of any contribution to positive LTP.","579":"There are trades between me and Vaishali Pandya which have been executed at LTP or below LTP but SEBI has No found anything wrong with them. r The price of the scrip was consistently rising during the Investigation period.","580":"In fact prior to the first impugned trade on 13.3.15 as per the Notice the price of the scrip had increased from Rs 9.16  on 1.9.14 to Rs 99  on 12.3.15. There were days when the Noticee had No traded and the price was increasing. s In light of the aforesaid it is clear that the allegation of trading with Vaishali Pandya to contribute to positive LTP is wholly misplaced.","581":"Further no motive has been alleged for trading the manner as erroneously alleged by SEBI.","582":"I reiterate that I have No manipulated the price of the scrip as alleged.","621":"Noticee in his reply has stated that as an Independent Director he cannot be held liable or responsible in any manner for the alleged delay in implementation of Code of Conduct on the part of Company.","626":"Therefore as an independent director he cannot be held liable for alleged delay in implementation of Code of Conduct on the part of the Company.","630":"In addition the relevant provisions do No provide any exemption to an independent Director from compliance of the said provision. f From the reply of the Noticee I observe that the Noticee himself admitted his period of directorship in the Company. g Noticee has further stated that the alleged violation pertains to the year 2002 and the said SCN for the said alleged violation has been issued in the year 2017 i.e  after more than 15 years.","647":"Further for the alleged nondisclosures for transactions on March 11 2015 and March 12 2015 he had inadvertently missed making disclosures to the Stock Exchange and on becoming aware of the said infringement he had made disclosures to the Exchange belatedly. e From the above it is evident that the Noticee admitted making delayed disclosures and thereby failed to comply with the aforesaid provisions regarding making disclosures within specified time period. f Therefore I conclude that the Noticee violated the provisions of Regulation 134 read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992 read with Regulation 12 of PIT Regulations 2015.","648":"C.
