Limited and Mishapur Investments Limited which were backed up by a pledge of shares of Adjudication Order in respect of Bajaj Holdings & Investment Limited In the matter of NOCIL September 30 2009 NOCIL with an asset backing of 150%.","582":"Initially in November December 1999 a pledge was taken in respect of 67 lakh equity shares of NOCIL.","583":"Due to fall in market price of NOCIL shares the security was refurbished in August 2000 to April 2001 by the pledge of additional 15 lakh shares of NOCIL.","584":"The total shares pledged with the noticee were for 82 lakh shares as security against investment in preference shares of SHL.","591":"In order to recover the investments made in SHL the pledge of NOCIL shares was invoked on 30th August 2004 and notice was also given to the guarantors on 14th September 2004 about the company\u2019s intention to sell the shares to realize its investment dues.","592":"Since the guarantors did No reply to the notice the shares were sold in the market during the period January \u2013 February 2005.","594":"For this reason after the insertion of explanation to Regulation 71 in September 2002 there was no requirement for Adjudication Order in respect of Bajaj Holdings & Investment Limited In the matter of NOCIL September 30 2009 disclosure at the time of invocation of pledge.","595":"Accordingly no disclosure was made by the noticee at that stage.","597":"Hence no disclosure was required under Regulation 71 at the time of sale of the pledged shares in JanuaryFebruary 2005.","600":"In the instant case although the change exceeded 2% in the total shareholding in the company since there had been no disclosure which was required previously there had been no change in holdings from the last disclosure made.","605":"Immediately on completion of the sale of shares the guarantors were informed of the small excess shares and amounts which the noticee wanted to return to them.","611":"The noticee argued that when the shares were taken on pledge regulation 13 1 was No in existence.","613":"It also reiterated that absolutely no malafide was involved in the above transactions.","621":"At the time of invocation of the pledge in 2004 although the term \u2018acquirer\u2019 included \u2018pledgee\u2019 invocation of pledge had No been mentioned as \u2018amounting to acquisition\u2019 in SAST Regulations.","624":"The noticee also added that it was significant to note that only under the recent amendments to the SEBI Takeover Code dated 28 January 2009 duty had been cast on promoters as well as the companies to make

shares of NOCIL were executed as security against investment in preference shares of SHL.","640":"I note that on 30 August 2004 82 lakh shares of NOCIL were transferred to Demat Account of the noticee on invocation of pledge which accounts for 6.69% of the paid up capital.","641":"I further note that the noticee trading through member India Bulls Securities Ltd sold 4165969 shares of NOCIL which accounts for more than 2% of the paid up capital during the period January 04 2005 to February 11 2005.","650":"The noticee should have made a disclosure the moment it gained title in the shares.","669":"However in the order Adjudication Order in respect of Bajaj Holdings & Investment Limited In the matter of NOCIL September 30 2009 appointing Adjudicating Officer it is observed that the noticee has been alleged to have violated Regulation 133 only.","674":"There is no material available on record to indicate any disproportionate gain or unfair advantage or amount of loss caused to an investor group of investors and also the repetitive nature of the default on the part of the noticee.","675":"I also find that the noticee did No make any profit by sale of the pledged shares but merely recovered his dues because of a default in payment on part of the guarantor.","676":"The amount of loss caused to the investors as a result of the default can No be quantified in the present case in view of the absence of any data material.","682":"Bajaj Holdings & Investment Limited formerly known as Bajaj Auto Ltd. would be commensurate with the violations.","699":"On September
