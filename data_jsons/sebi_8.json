shareholding was to become 4.49% of total equity capital.","366":"However it appears that instead of complete conversion of 3 crore warrants Rs 30 crores the conversion of 248500000 warrants Rs 24.85 crores took place in February 2010 and hence noticee\u2019s holding became 5.21% instead of 4.49% as planned earlier.","367":"Further the remaining 51500000 warrants got converted into equity shares

its shareholding would have been 4.49% only which is less than 5%.","438":"But without notice to the Noticee the company converted 248500000 warrants Rs 24.85 crores instead of 3 crore warrants into equity shares in February 2010 which led to the shareholding of the Noticee to be 5.21% as against 4.49% as originally planned.","439":"Further the remaining 51500000 warrants got converted into equity shares in May 2010 and accordingly the noticee\u2019s holding got reduced to 4.49% as mentioned in the notice dated 05.11.2009.","440":"Hence the shareholding of Noticee crossed 5% only for a

acquisition of noticee was 5.21%.","457":"In the instant matter I find that the shareholding of the noticee post conversion of warrants into equity shares was 5.33% which is below the limits prescribed under regulation 111 or under second proviso to Regulation 112 of SAST Regulations 1997.","463":"It is also an admitted fact that the said summons was received by the Noticee and vide
