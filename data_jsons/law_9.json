ESOPs prior to listing of MCX.","256":"He further submitted that he had sold the shares from time to time inter alia based on his personal requirement in the ordinary course for meeting personal family expenses and some due to media reports rumors about imposition of CTT in the market.","257":"He also submitted that as on date he continues to hold 20000 shares of MCX.","264":"I note that the prohibition contained in regulation 3 of the PIT Regulations 1992 apply only when an insider trades or deals in securities on the basis of any UPSI and No otherwise and the Noticee has been able to show that he did No trade on the basis of UPSI rather the fact of his sale of shares of MCX was predetermined and was mentioned in the Prospectus of MCX date February 28 2012.","267":"For the

using the web link https siportal.sebi.gov.in intermediary AOPaymentGateway.html.","385":"The Noticee inter alia submitted that the demat shares continued to be in the name of the sellers Shri Chirantan Mukherji and group since the same could No be transferred in favour of the buyers Ramayana.","386":"They moved the High Court of Calcutta when their effort to transfer the shares in their name failed.","404":"It is alleged in the SCN that the Board of Directors of SIPL approved a Shares Purchase Agreement at its meeting held on July 30 2009 to be executed between the SIPL and the proposed acquirers on July 31 2009 for the sale of the issued and subscribed equity share capital of the company held by the erstwhile promoters as also change in management of the

the Shares transfer documents its name could No be entered into the list of members shareholder of the company and it was pledged with its banker SBI as well.","427":"They had compliance issues such as the buyer paying 10 crore to the erstwhile promoters for acquiring 35.5% stake in the Company and paid 6 crore to public shareholders to buy 20% shareholding from them as statutorily required.","428":"Despite all their efforts they did No get their dues and therefore had to move the judiciary.","429":"They allowed the existing Whole time Director Shri Mahiruha Mukherji to complete

officer to take care of the compliance issues.","432":"The Noticee further submitted that it is the duty of the pledgor to release the shares from the pledgee and then transfer.","433":"But in this case the pledgor neither released the pledged shares No instructed the pledgee to create a new charge in the name of the buyer as a result of the transfer of shares in question.","434":"From the above it is clear that shares in question were No registered in the name of the buyer in the register of members of the company for the purpose of being called a shareholder promoter and that might be the reason that Shri K. L. Surana erstwhile Compliance officer did No report it in the share holding pattern or would be under influence of previous management to show the seller side as controller of company in form of promoter on record to put them in a better position to bargain.","435":"Also unfortunately most of the omissions happened during his tenure and he is No available to respond to the queries.","436":"The buyer or its promoters have No done anything to violate any law.","437":"None of them made any unethical or illegal gain from the alleged violations.","453":"However the Noticee also submitted that it is clearly the responsibility of the compliance officer to comply with the said regulation.","484":"As per the Investigation Report hereinafter referred to as IR Shri Arunkumar Ramanlal Choksi hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Noticee\u2019 alleged to have violated the Regulation 133 read with 135 of the SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulation 1992 hereinafter referred to as the \u2018PIT Regulations\u2019 for which the adjudication proceeding has been initiated and therefore the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty for the alleged violations as prescribed under section 15Ab of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act1992 hereinafter referred to as \u2018SEBI Act\u2019.","516":"However the Noticee alleged to have failed to make the disclosure about his shareholding pattern as per the regulatory requirement.","527":"It is observed that the said SEBI Order was pertaining to the violations of various provisions of SEBI Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market Regulations 2003 where as the instant proceedings were pertaining to the violations of SEBI PIT Regulations.","529":"Further it is also derived from the said SEBI Order that the Noticee never appeared before the competent authority of SEBI and therefore WTM SEBI had passed an exparte order dt. 12.10.2009 against the Noticee.","574":"However it is alleged that the Noticee has failed to make aforesaid disclosures. c In view of the above facts and observations it is alleged that Noticee has violated Regulation 134A read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992 by No making required disclosures to the Company and Stock Exchanges.","636":"Name of payee 3.","637":"Date of payment 4.","638":"Amount paid 5.","639":"Transaction no.","649":"Shri Ravi Bhandari PAN ADQPR8496J 2.","650":"Ms Rekha Bhandari PAN  AAHPR8192A 3.","651":"Ravi Bhandari HUF PAN  AAJHR4856E 4.","652":"Lollipop Fashions Private Limited PAN AACCL1423B 5.","653":"Shri Samir Ghosh PAN  AMPPG0185K 6.","705":"The details of the said agreements are as under Date of the Agreement Pledgor Pledgee Loan Amount   No of Shares provided for pledge 18.10.2013 Ravi Bhandari Chirag N Shah 1000000 100000 18.10.2013 Ravi Bhandari PragneshDoshi 3000000 280000 27.11.2013 Anshus Clothing Limited Samir Ghosh proprietor of S.K.
