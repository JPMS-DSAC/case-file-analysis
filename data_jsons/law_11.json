same.","60":"The two charges which have been held established read as under \u201cIt is alleged that you had failed to make announcements disclosure with regard to the following price sensitive information i.","63":"It appears from the announcements of your company that you were purchasing a company by paying cash from your general reserves.","64":"However the deal was structured in such a way that sellers would subscribe to redeemable preference shares of your company for an equivalent amount of the sale price and the sellers would in turn wire back the same amount to you towards subscription to preference shares.","65":"The issue of preference shares which is allegedly willfully withheld from shareholders for the specific purpose of buying the company from the sellers negates all connotations of a \u201ccash deal. ii.","66":"It has been alleged in the disclosure dated May 12 2005 you had informed that all the procedural formalities for acquisition of the 3 vMoksha companies were completed.","68":"It has been alleged that you had prima facie misled investors by stating that the deal was complete whereas the deal was No complete in entirety and was still subject to compliance of certain conditions.\u201d","71":"What has been flashed on the website is the relevant extract from the press release and the two are almost the same except that a few other matters No relevant to the present controversy were omitted by BSE.","78":"The payment may be made by Noticee in cash and the preference shares may be redeemed in cash but at the time of making the announcement the deal was No an all cash deal because calling it a cash deal would make the investors presume that no other conditions stand attached to the deal.","79":"However that is No the situation in the present case.","87":"The biggest obligation to be completed was on the part of the Noticee i.e  the payment of consideration which happened only on June 30 2005.","88":"In such a case how could the deal be said to be completed when the SPA in clause 4 gives conditions precedent to the completion which includes payment by the Noticee to the sellers.","98":"We have heard the learned counsel for the parties who have taken us through the record and the impugned order.","99":"As already noticed above the charge regarding violation of the FUTP regulations is primarily based on the findings recorded by the adjudicating officer that the disclosures made by the appellant in the press release dated May 11 2005 were inaccurate and incomplete.","101":"He has also found that the appellant had misled the investors by stating that the deal was complete whereas the deal was No complete in entirety and that it was a cash deal when in fact it was not.","106":"There is a format prescribed by SEBI which is contained in its manuals and every listing agreement has to be in that format.","112":"No having done so it 10 clearly violated this clause of the listing agreement.","119":"Since the information regarding issue of preference shares by the appellant to the sellers being price sensitive had No been disclosed in the press release on May 11 2005 we are in agreement with the adjudicating officer that the appellant violated clause 36 of the listing agreement and also the aforesaid clause 2.1 of Schedule II to the PIT regulations.","121":"We have gone through the press release issued by the appellant on May 11 2005 and we do No think that it creates an impression that the acquisition was being made by the appellant by paying cash from its general reserves as is alleged in the show cause notice.","122":"The deal was a cash deal and we say so because the consideration that was paid by the appellant to the sellers for the acquisition was by way of cash which had been remitted by wire transfer through normal banking channels and simultaneously the amount which the sellers gave to the appellants as application money for the redeemable preference shares had also been transferred in a similar manner.","123":"It is in this context that the deal is said to be a cash deal.","125":"Acquisitions and mergers of companies do take place where instead of paying cash the shares of the companies are swapped among the shareholders.","126":"That is No the case here.","127":"The learned 11 counsel for the respondent Board brought to our notice clause 2.2.3 of the SPA which provides that if prior approval from FIPB could No be obtained the parties had agreed to mutually amend the SPA for acquiring the vMoksha entities on a stock swap basis.","128":"It is with reference to this clause that the learned counsel for the Board strenuously argued that the deal in the present case was No a cash deal.","129":"We are unable to agree with him.","130":"It is common ground between the parties that FIPB approval had been obtained on June 30 2005 where upon on the same day sale consideration was remitted to the sellers and simultaneously the sellers remitted the application money for the issue of redeemable preference shares through wire transfer and it was cash that was transferred through normal banking channels.","133":"It is alleged that it misled the investors by stating that the deal was complete when it was No complete in its entirety.","136":"It is common case of the parties that on May 11 2005 three agreements had been executed between the appellant and the sellers namely SPA SSA and the Escrow agreement.","137":"It is also No in dispute that the sellers had executed share transfer deeds in favour of the appellant and those transfer deeds along with the share certificates held by them with regard to vMoksha entities were delivered to the Escrow agents.","141":"All this had been done by the sellers and the appellant on June 30 2005.","142":"In other words the sellers and the appellant had performed their respective parts of the contract and the only thing that remained was that sellers had to formally accept the resignation letters of their directors which had already been submitted and they were also to formally approve the transfer of shares in the name of the appellant for which all the relevant and necessary documents had been executed.","152":"In the present case the deal was that the sale consideration by the appellant was to be paid simultaneously when the sellers invested an equal amount towards redeemable preference shares of the appellant company.","154":"As already noticed the sellers had committed themselves for the transfer of the shares of vMoksha entities in favour of the appellant when they deposited with the Escrow agent No only the share certificates but also the transfer deeds duly executed in favour of the appellant alongwith their resignation letters.","155":"It is by No well settled that in the case of transfer of shares held in the physical form the 13 transfer is complete the moment blank transfer deeds are executed by the sellers and delivered to the purchaser.","163":"The word sale in its popular sense or in common parlance has a wider import that what it has in its legal sense.","164":"In its popular sense sale is said to take place when the bargain is settled between the parties though property in the goods may No pass at that stage.","165":"Similarly when the appellant said in the press release that \u201cThe acquisition of the 3 vMoksha companies is complete\u2026\u2026.\u201d it meant that the bargain had been struck and in that sense the acquisition was complete because the sellers do No have an exit route except by committing breach 14 of the contract.","167":"When persons doing commerce use these terms in their popular sense their statements cannot be said to be misleading warranting penal action.","169":"In the result the appeal is partly allowed and the findings of the adjudicating officer on the second charge are set aside so also the penalty of 25 lacs imposed on this count.","172":"Consequently the penalty imposed for the violation is reduced to 15 lacs.","174":"Sd  Justice N.

Nahata as a security in connection therewith.","280":"However upon the said loan from Komal Nahata No materializing ACL has turned down the loan proposal and called back the said shares of AIL from Komal Nahata.","281":"The above facts show that the transfer of subject shares by ACL to KN and re transfer from KN to ACL had No been resulted due to any agreement transaction of purchase or sale of subject shares and therefore ACL was under impression and understanding that no disclosure was required to be made pursuant to such transfer of shares by ACL under Regulation 71 read with Regulation 72 of SEBISAST Regulations and Regulation 133 of SEBI PIT regulations.","285":"AR has also submitted that by mistake they did No fill the pledge form for taking loan and since loan was No materialized so the shares were transferred back from KN.","286":"AR was further queried as to why it took so long to transfer back the shares AR could No reply expressed his unawareness.","287":"When AR was
