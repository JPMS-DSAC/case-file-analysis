be made within 2 working days of a the receipt of intimidation of allotment of shares or b the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights as the case may be.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the present case are i.\nWhether Noticee acquired shares more than 5% of the paid capital of the company and violated Regulation 71 read with 72 of SAST Regulations? ii.\nWhether Noticee has violated Regulation 133 read with 135 of PIT Regulations? iii.\nDoes the violation if any on the part of the Noticee attract monetary penalty under Section 15A b of SEBI Act? iv.\nIf so what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act?\nMTZ Industries Limited in the matter of MTZ Polyfilms Limited FINDINGS 11.\nI now proceed with the alleged violations of SAST and PIT Regulations. i.\nI observe that the shareholding of the Noticee as per disclosures made by the company for the quarters June and September 2009 was as under Quarter ending Total Shares of MTZ Polyfilms Limited Shares held by MTZ Industries Limited % shareholding of MTZ Industries Limited June 2009 89355760 16801618 18.80% September 2009 89355760 15385391 17.22% ii.\nI note from the SEBI data of the NSDL for holding more than 1% that as on 17.09.2009 that Noticee was holding 9760391 shares representing 10.92% of shareholding of the company.\nThe paid‐up capital of the company during July 2009 to September 2010 was 89355760 shares.\nThus the Noticee was holding more than 5% of the paid up capital of the company. iii.\nDuring the period between quarter ending June 2009 and September 2009 Noticee transferred 5625000 shares representing 6.3% of shareholding of the company on 10.07.2009 04.08.2009 and 17.09.2009 in off‐market transfers to  Mr Bajranglal Sharma.\nThe details of the off‐market transfer between the two entities for various dates during July 2009 till September 2009 is as under iv.\nIt is observed that  Mr Bajranaglal Sharma then transferred 5625000 shares off‐ market to the Noticee on 13.07.2010 13.08.2010 08.09.2010 14.09.2010.\nThe Execution Date Quantity Sell BO Name Buy BO Name

Industries Limited in the matter of MTZ Polyfilms Limited details of the off‐market transfer between the two entities for various dates during July 2010 till September 2010 is as under v.\nThe allegation against the Noticee is that it acquired shares which crossed more than 10% and 14% of the paid up capital of the company further the transfers also resulted in change in holding of more than 2% but the required disclosures were not made under SAST and PIT.\nThe details of change of shareholding on various dates was as under • Shares transferred to  Mr Bajranglal Sharma Date of

were required to be made Further I observe from the table that on 13.08.2010 the holding of the Noticee crossed 10% and on 14.09.2010 its holding crossed 14% for acquiring shares from  Mr Bajranglal Sharma.\nHence the Noticee was required to make disclosures to the company and the exchange as required under Regulation 71 of SAST within 2 working days of the respective date of acquisition as required under Regulation 72 of SAST Regulations. vii.\nNoticee in its reply has claimed that the above transactions were not of a sale and purchase but of a pledge of shares and therefore the Noticee has not violated the provisions of SEBI PIT and SAST Regulations.\nFrom the documents before me I observe that the shares were recorded in the name of  Mr Bajranglal Sharma when those shres were transferred to MTZ Industries Limited in the matter of MTZ Polyfilms Limited him in 2009 for availing finance.\nI note that in terms of Section 10 of the Depositories Act 1996 the beneficial owner is the person whose name is recorded as such with a depository and is entitled to all the rights and benefits and also subjected to all liabilities in respect of its his securities held by a depository.\nAs per Section 41 3 of the Companies Act 1956 “Every person holding equity share capital of a company and whose name is entered as beneficial owner in the records of the depository shall be deemed to be a member of the concerned company”.\nFurther as per Section 152A of the said Act the register and index of beneficial owners maintained by a depository under Section 11 of the Depositories Act 1996 shall be deemed to be an index of members and register and index of debenture holders as the case may be.\nFurther any transfer of securities from the beneficial owner account would be construed as change in ownership in respect of those securities which have been transferred to another beneficiary depository account.\nFrom the Demat Instructions submitted by the Noticee I find that the nature of transaction of the Noticee and  Mr Bajranglal Sharma was an off‐market transfers of shares where the beneficiary ownership had transferred to the transferee. ix.\nI have perused the agreement dated July 09 2009 entered into between the Noticee and  Mr Sanjay Bajranglal Sharma.\nClause 6.1 provides that in the event of default in repayment of the outstanding amount by the Noticee to lender the lender shall be required to give 15 days notice to the company to set right the default before dealing parting and or selling disposing off the said shares to the third person at the prevailing market price.\nFurther as per clause 8.1 of the agreement the lender in the event of default and after giving notice as per clause 6.1 shall in all cases give the borrower the first right to purchase the said shares.\nThus it can be seen that the securities MTZ Industries Limited in the matter of MTZ Polyfilms Limited have been transferred by the Noticee to  Mr Bajranglal Sharma for the purpose of finance availed or to be availed by it and there was change in beneficial ownership of the shares.\nThe plea of the Noticee that the said shares were pledged to  Mr Sanjay Bajranglal Sharma by way of the aforesaid agreement could have been justified had those shares been pledged in accordance with the provisions of the Depositories Act 1996 Securities and Exchange Board of India Depositories and Participants Regulations 1996 hereinafter referred to as DP Regulations and the Bye‐laws and business rules of the depositories.\n‘Pledge’ or ‘hypothecation’ under the depository system does No involve any transfer of shares from the pledger to the pledgee as only an entry is recorded in respect of the securities so pledged or hypothecated which would evidence the creation of a pledge.\nFurther pledge or hypothecation of securities held in a depository shall be made as per the method and manner prescribed under the provisions of the Depositories Act 1996 DP Regulations and the Bye laws of the depositories.\nSection 12 of the Depositories Act 1996 provides for pledge or hypothecation of securities held in a depository which is reproduced herein below Pledge or hypothecation of securities held in a depository‐ 12.\n1 Subject to such regulations and bye‐laws as may be made in this behalf a beneficial owner may with the previous approval of the depository create a pledge or hypothecation in respect of a security owned by him through a depository.\n2 Every beneficial owner shall give intimation of such pledge or hypothecation to the depository and such depository shall thereupon make entries in its records accordingly.\n3 Any entry in the records of a depository under sub‐section 2 shall be evidence of a pledge or hypothecation.\nFurther Regulation 58 of the DP Regulations provides for the manner of MTZ Industries Limited in the matter of MTZ Polyfilms Limited creating pledge or hypothecation the same is reproduced herein below for reference Manner of creating pledge or hypothecation‐ 58.\n1 If a beneficial owner intends to create a pledge on a security owned by him he shall make an application to the depository through the participant who has his account in respect of such securities.\n2 The participant after satisfaction that the securities are available for pledge shall make a note in its records of the notice of pledge and forward the application to the depository.\n3 The depository after confirmation from the pledgee that the securities are available for pledge with the pledger shall within fifteen days of the receipt of the application create and record the pledge and send an intimation of the same to the participants of the pledger and the pledgee.\n4 On receipt of the intimation under sub‐regulation 3 the participants of both the pledger and the pledgee shall inform the pledger and the pledgee respectively of the entry of creation of the pledge.\n6 The entry of pledge made under sub‐regulation 3 may be cancelled by the depository if pledger or the pledgee makes an application to the depository through its participant Provided that no entry of pledge shall be cancelled by the depository without prior concurrence of the pledgee.\n7 The depository on the cancellation of the entry of pledge shall inform the participant of the pledger.\n8 Subject to the provisions of the pledge document the pledgee may invoke the pledge and on such invocation the depository shall register the pledgee as beneficial owner of such securities and amend its records accordingly.\nMTZ Industries Limited in the matter of MTZ Polyfilms Limited 9 After amending its records under sub‐regulation 8 the depository shall immediately inform the participants of the pledger and pledgee of the change who in turn shall make the necessary changes in their records and inform the pledger and pledgee respectively.\n10 a If a beneficial owner intends to create a hypothecation on a security owned by him he may do so in accordance with the provisions of sub‐ regulations 1 to 9. b The provisions of sub‐regulations 1 to 9 shall mutatis mutandis apply in such cases of hypothecation Provided that the depository before registering the hypothecatee as a beneficial owner shall obtain the prior concurrence of the hypothecator.\n11 No transfer of security in respect of which a notice or entry of pledge or hypothecation is in force shall be effected by a participant without the concurrence of the pledgee or the hypothecatee as the case may be. x.\nNSDL in Bye law 9.9 and CDSL in Bye law 14 have prescribed the procedures to be followed while creating a pledge on the securities held in their depositories.\nA depository creates and records the pledge only after receiving a confirmation from the depository participant of the pledgee.\nIn the present case Noticee had transferred 5625000 shares to  Mr Sanjay Bajranglal Sharma by way of an agreement when the said shares were in dematerialised mode and held by the depositories.\nIn this context Noticee submitted that the transactions entered between the entities by way of agreement was that of lending which was secured by collateral security in form of pledge of equity shares held by the Noticee.\nAccording to the Noticee the principle reason for doing so was to enable  Mr Bajranglal Sharma to obtain finance against the said shares.\nThough Noticee contends so it failed to produce the documents for pledging of the shares and comply with the legal requirements prescribed for pledge of MTZ Industries Limited in the matter of MTZ Polyfilms Limited shares in the depository system.\nTherefore pledge of dematerialised securities shall be created as per the provisions of the Depositories Act 1996 DP Regulations and the bye laws of the depositories.\nI further find that Section 123 of Depositories Act 1996 mentions that any entry in the records of a depository shall be evidence of a pledge or hypothecation.\nThe reason for creating a pledge in the manner as specified under Section 12 of the Depositories Act 1996 read with Regulation 58 of the DP Regulations is to have proper record of securities held in a particular beneficiary account.\nI note that even as per the agreement Clause 7.1 between Noticee and  Mr Bajranglal Sharma provides for the recording creation of pledge which is reproduced herein “The Borrower shall pledge the 12.50 lakhs equity shares of the MTZ Polyfilms Limited with the lender in demat mode within 7 days for the date of the agreement”.\nAs per the said clause the Borrower MTZ Polyfilms MTZ Industries Limited in the matter of MTZ Polyfilms Limited Limited agreed to create an exclusive pledge in favour of the lender  Mr Bajranglal Sharma of 12.50 lakhs equity shares of the company.\nAs already stated above no pledge was marked in the depository account of the Noticee in respect of those securities which were pledged or were to be pledged for the purposes of securing the loan from  Mr Bajranglal Sharma.\nI also note from the clause 9.9.2 of Bye Laws of NSDL that “the pledgor and the pledgee must have an account in the Depository to create a pledge” and as per clause 2.1.6 Depository means “National Securities Depository Limited”.\nI further note from clause 8.5.1 of the Operating Instructions of CDSL that “the pledgor and the pledgee must have accounts in CDSL to create a pledge”.\nIn the present matter I note that NSDL is the depository of the Noticee and CDSL is the depository of  Mr Bajranglal Sharma.\nFurther I find nothing available in ‘Demat Instruction’ showing that any form of pledge or hypothecation was created over the shares.\nAs stated in para 11 vi the Noticee was required to make disclosures under Regulation 133 read with 5 of PIT and Regulation 71 read with 2 of the SAST Regulations.\nFrom the information given by BSE and the submission of the Noticee it is observed that the Noticee did not make the required disclosures.\nThe next issue for consideration as to whether the failure on the part of the Noticee to comply with the provisions of Regulation 71 read with 2 of the SAST and Regulation 133 read with 5 of PIT attracts monetary penalty under section 15Ab of SEBI Act and if so what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed on the Noticee.\nIn view of the foregoing I am convinced that it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under section 15Ab of the SEBI Act which reads as under 15Ab.\nPenalty for failure to furnish information return etc.‐ To file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15A b of SEBI Act it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under MTZ Industries Limited in the matter of MTZ Polyfilms Limited “15J ‐ Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15‐I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely‐ a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.”\nIt is an admitted fact that the Noticee had not made the disclosure as required and hence there was no dissemination of information to the general investor.\nAfter taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case I impose a penalty of 300000 Rupees Three lakh only under Section 15A b of SEBI Act on the Noticee which will be commensurate with the violations committed by it.\nThe Noticee shall pay the said amount of penalty by way of demand draft in favour of “SEBI ‐ Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai within 45 days of receipt of this order.\nThe said demand draft should be forwarded to  Mr Shashi Kumar Deputy General Manager Investigations Department SEBI Bhavan Plot No.\nC – 4 A “G” Block Bandra Kurla Complex Bandra E Mumbai – 400 051.\nIn terms of rule 6 of the Rules copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.\nDate September 21 2011 BARNALI

mail dated April 22 2013 are as under i That the impugned sell trades were as a result of lender entities to whom the Noticee had pledged the shares of the company invoking the said pledge.\nConsideration of Issues Evidence and Findings 6.\nI have carefully perused the documents available on record written and oral submissions made by the Noticee.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the present case are a.\nWhether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Clause 4.2 of Schedule I under Regulation 12 1 of PIT Regulations? b.\nDoes the violation if any on the part of the Noticee attract penalty under section 15HB of SEBI Act? c.\nIf so how much penalty should be imposed on the Noticee taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act?\nThe relevant provisions of the PIT Regulations are as follows PIT Regulations 1992.\nRegulation 12  Code of internal procedures and conduct for listed companies and other entities Schedule I  Part A Clause 4.2 All directors officers designated employees who buy or sell any number of shares of the company shall No enter into an opposite transaction i.e  sell or buy any number of shares during the next six months following the prior transaction.\nAll Adjudication Order in respect of Ramesh Yerramsetti in the matter of GSS America Infotech Limited April 29 2013� directors officers designated employees shall also No take positions in derivative transactions in the shares of the company at any time.\nI further find that the Noticee was trading in the shares of the company and the following buy and sell trades entered by the Noticee resulted in opposite transactions i.e  buy or sell of shares of the company during the next six months following the prior transaction.\nOn 30.03.2010 he purchased and sold 250000 shares.\nFrom the period 17.08.2010 to 08.12.2010 he again purchased 293653 shares in six transactions.\nOn 16.12.2010 and 20.12.2010 he sold a total of 413000

considered the contentions of the Noticee made vide letter dated November 28 2012 during the personal hearing before me and also the documents additional submissions forwarded by him vide letter dated April 22 2013.\nI have also perused the affidavit executed by the compliance officer of the company in support of the above contentions of the Noticee and also the copies of the disclosures made to the stock exchanges regarding the creation invocation of the pledge.\nI find that the Noticee was very actively purchasing and selling the shares of the company in large quantities and on many occasions.\nI find that during the period from 03.11.2009 to 12.10.2012 the Noticee has altogether purchased a total of 985121 shares and sold 1253000 shares of the company.\nOn some days the Noticee has both purchased and sold the shares.\nThe purchases also imply that he had the funds to purchase the companys shares.\nI further note that the documents submitted by the Noticee in support of the invocation of pledge do No substantiate the sale transactions appearing in his account.\nThe only documents produced are the copies of disclosures made to stock exchanges regarding creation invocation of pledge.\nFurther it is observed that the Noticee has sold 250000 shares of the company on March 30 2010.\nThe Noticee has submitted that this transaction was done for the purpose of tax planning

both purchase and sale transactions for 250000 shares each.\nThe compliance officer has inter alia stated that in terms of the clarification to PIT Regulations issued by SEBI he has exercised his discretion and waived the six month prohibition on entering into opposite Adjudication Order in respect of Ramesh Yerramsetti in the matter of GSS America Infotech Limited April 29 2013�

REPLY AND HEARING 4.\nA Show Cause Notice A&E EAD1 SBM 18300 1 2018 dated June 27 2018 herein after referred to as ‘SCN’ was issued to the Noticee under Rule 41 of the Adjudication Rules to showcause as to why an inquiry should No be initiated against the Noticee and why penalty should No be imposed upon the Noticee under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act for the violations alleged to have been committed by the Noticee.\nThe details in respect of the alleged violation by the Noticee are as given below a.\nSix transactions with respect to invocation of pledge of shares in the scrip of CTL during December 2015 totaling to 20494000 shares held by the Noticee were observed.\nIn terms of Regulations 312 of SAST Regulations the promoter of every target company shall disclose details of any invocation of such encumbrance or release of such encumbrance of shares in such form as may be specified.\nFurther Regulation 31 3 of SAST Regulations 2011 requires the reporting of such encumbered shares within seven working days from the creation or invocation or release of encumbrance as the case may be to a every stock exchange where the shares of the target company are listed; and b the target company at its registered office. b.\nIt was further observed that pursuant to the aforesaid invocation of pledge the shareholding of Noticee in CTL had reduced from 136176272 shares 36.01% to 115682272 shares 30.59% i.e  a change in shareholding by 5.42% of total shareholding of CTL.\nSince the disposal of shares by Noticee due to the invocation of pledge by the pledgee was in excess of 2% of the total paid up share capital of the CTL.\nNoticee was required to make disclosure to the stock exchanges and to the target company in terms of Regulation 292 read with Regulation 293 of SAST Regulations within two working days of the Adjudication Order in respect of Amtek Auto Limited disposal of shares.\nSimilarly the Noticee was also required to disclose the number of such securities disposed off to the company within two trading days of such transaction as the value of securities traded disposed of shares exceeded the value as specified under Regulation 72a of PIT Regulations. c.\nIt is alleged that Noticee had failed to disclose the invocation of pledge of 20494000 shares during the quarter ended on December 31 2015 to the stock exchanges and the Company and thereby violated the provisions of Regulation 312 read with Regulation 313 of SAST Regulations.\nIt is also alleged that Noticee had failed to disclose change in shareholding in the company by 5.42% to the stock exchanges and to the company as required under Regulation 292 read with 293 of SAST Regulation and also failed to disclose the number of securities disposed as per Regulation 72a of PIT Regulations to the company as the value of transaction exceeded ten lakh rupees.\nTherefore in view of the above observations it is alleged that Noticee has violated provisions of Regulation 312 read with Regulation 313 & Regulation 292 read with 293 of SAST Regulation and Regulation 72a of PIT Regulations.\nThe SCN issued to the Noticee was duly delivered.\nThe Noticee vide letter dated July 21 2018 submitted reply to the SCN and inter alia made the following submissions i.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Amtek Auto Limited iii.\nThat in terms of provisions of Section 14 of the IBC a

the SCN has rightly identified that it has No made disclosures in terms of Regulation 312 read with Regulation 313 & Regulation 292 read with 293 of SAST Regulation and Regulation 72a of PIT Regulations for the invocation of its 20494000 shares. ii.\nThe Noticee submitted that it did No receive any intimation regarding invocation of its pledged shares by the pledgee the State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Amtek Auto Limited iii.\nThat in terms of provisions of Section 14 of the IBC a complete moratorium operates against companies undergoing CIRP till completion of CIRP period. v.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES 8.\nI have carefully perused the charges levelled against the Noticee his reply and the documents material available on record.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the present case are a Whether the Noticee has violated Regulation 292 read with regulations 293 Regulation 312 read with Regulation 313 of SAST Regulation and Regulation 72a of PIT Regulations? b Does the violation if any attract monetary penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act? c If so what would be the quantum of monetary penalty that can be imposed on the Noticee after taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act?\nAdjudication Order in respect of Amtek Auto Limited 9.\nI note that the Noticee in its reply has inter alia stated that it is undergoing insolvency proceedings in the Hon’ble NCLT.\nI observe that the Hon’ble NCLT vide its order dated July 27 2017 in the matter of Corporation Bank vs Amtek Auto Limited [in CPIB No 42 Chd Hry 2017] has ordered the initiation of corporate insolvency resolution proceedings against the Noticee and declared moratorium under Section 131 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 hereinafter referred to as ‘IBC’ for a period of 180 days which was extended by 90 days i.e  till middle of April 2018 by NCLT in its order dated January 17 2018.\nI note from the NCLT order dated February 13 2019 that it has excluded the period March 05 2018 upto the date of receipt of the copy of its order dated February 13 2019 while calculating the period of 270 days for completion of the resolution plan.\nOnce a moratorium has been declared Section 141 of the IBC inter alia prohibits the institution of suits or continuation of pending suits or proceedings against the corporate debtor including execution of any judgement decree or order in any court of law tribunal arbitration panel or other authority.\nI further note that Section 144 of the IBC states that – “The order of moratorium shall have effect from the date of such order till the completion of the corporate insolvency resolution process Provided that where at any time during the corporate insolvency resolution process period if the Adjudicating Authority approves the resolution plan under subsection 1 of section 31 or passes an order for liquidation of corporate debtor under section 33 the moratorium shall cease to have effect from the date of such approval or liquidation order as the case may be.”\nI note from the website of the Hon’ble NCLT that as on May 24 2019 that the status of the insolvency proceedings in respect of the Noticee is being shown as ‘Pending’.\nIn view of the above it has to be first determined whether the present proceedings can be continued or not.\nThe notes on clauses for section 14 read as follows emphasis supplied “the purposes of the moratorium include keeping the corporate debtors assets together during the insolvency resolution process and facilitating orderly completion of the processes envisaged during the insolvency resolution process and ensuring that the company may continue as a going concern while the creditors take a view on resolution of default” and “the moratorium on initiation and continuation of legal proceedings including debt enforcement action ensures a standstill period during which creditors cannot resort to individual enforcement action which may frustrate the object of the corporate insolvency resolution process.”\nSuch an amount determined by any court or authority during the moratorium period may No form part of the insolvency resolution process as the claims by a IRP RP are verified as “on the insolvency commencement date”1.\nHowever for such claims to be filed in liquidation they should stand determined as on the liquidation commencement date.\nAs per section 335 of the Code in liquidation no suit or other legal proceedings shall be instituted by or against the corporate debtor without the prior approval of the NCLT.\nFurther it appears that no liquidation order in respect of the Noticee has been passed.\nBefore proceeding further I would like to refer to the relevant provisions of the SAST and PIT Regulations as below Relevant provisions of SAST Regulations Disclosure of acquisition and disposal 29.1 ............. Adjudication Order in respect of Amtek Auto Limited 2 Any acquirer who together with persons acting in concert with him holds shares or voting rights entitling them to five per cent or more of the shares or voting rights in a target company shall disclose every acquisition or disposal of shares of such target company representing two per cent or more of the shares or voting rights in such target company in such form as may be specified.\n3 The disclosures required under subregulation 1 and subregulation 2 shall be made within two working days of the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares or the acquisition of shares or voting rights in the target company to— a every stock exchange where the shares of the target company are listed;

and b the Target Company at its registered office within two working days from receipt of intimation of the disposal of shares in the target company when there is a change in its shareholding and such change exceeds 2% of total shareholding.\nI note that the Noticee was holding 36.01% of paid up share capital of CTL in quarter ending on September 30 2015 which is much more than 5%.\nFurther I note from the Table – 1 that the shareholding of the Noticee reduced by 3.636% on December 02 2015 i.e  a change of more than 2%.\nTherefore the Noticee was required to make disclosures in this regard to the Adjudication Order in respect of Amtek Auto Limited stock exchanges and CTL in terms of Regulation 292 read with Regulation 293 of SAST Regulations.\nI note that Regulation 72a of the PIT Regulations states that every promoter of the Company shall disclose to the Company the number of such securities acquired or disposed of within two trading days of such transaction if the value of the securities traded whether in one transaction or a series of transactions over any calendar quarter aggregates to a traded value in excess of ten lakh rupees.\nI note that the Noticee is a promoter of CTL and its 81524800 shares were pledged in the quarter ending on September 30 2015.\nAs seen from the Table – 1 that on December 02 & 03 2015 the pledge was invoked and a total 13750000 & 6744000 shares were debited from the account of the Noticee on December 02 & 03 2015.\nFurther the closing share price of CTL on December 02 & 03 2015 was 18.30 and 18.50 respectively.\nThe aggregate market value of invoked shares calculated on the basis of closing prices comes out to be 251625000  and 124764000  on respective days which is much more than threshold value of 1000000  as specified in Regulation 72a of PIT Regulations.\nTherefore the Noticee was required to make disclosures in accordance with Regulation 72a of PIT Regulations to the Company for the pledge invoked on December 02 & 03 2015.\nI note from the email dated March 14 2018 from NSE that it has No received any disclosure for the aforesaid transactions.\nNSE also informed vide aforesaid email that it had sent a letter dated February 19 2016 to the Company wherein clarification with respect to the reduction in the shareholding of the Noticee along with necessary disclosures in terms of SAST and PIT Regulations was sought from the Company.\nThe Company in its reply vide letter dated March 01 2016 to the NSE informed that the State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur Herein after referred to as ‘SBBJ’ invoked the pledge and debited 20494000 shares from the account Adjudication Order in respect of Amtek Auto Limited of the Noticee.\nHowever the Company has neither submitted copies of any disclosure in this regard No furnished any information with respect to the required disclosures in terms of SAST and PIT Regulations.\nI also note from the reply of the Noticee that it has admitted that it did No make any disclosure in terms of SAST and PIT Regulations with respect to the invocation of 20494000 pledged shares by SBBJ.\nHaving offered the shares on pledge the Noticee cannot claim that the invocation of the pledge by the pledgee was without informing him.\nTherefore the Noticee ought to have made the disclosures of for the aforesaid six 6 transactions of invocation of the pledge of shares to the Company and the Adjudication Order in respect of Amtek Auto Limited stock exchanges in accordance with Regulation 311 and Regulation 313 of SAST Regulations.\nI note that the Noticee in its reply has admitted that he has failed to make disclosures to the stock exchanges and the Company in terms of Regulation 312 read with Regulation 313 & Regulation 292 read with 293 of SAST Regulation and Regulation 72a of PIT Regulations.\nTherefore irrespective of the fact as to whether the shares were purchased from open market or shares were received on account of amalgamation or by way of bonus shares if as a result of such acquisition receipt percentage of shares held by that person exceeds the limits prescribed under the respective regulations then it is mandatory to make disclosures under those regulations.”\nIn view of the above I am convinced that it is a fit case for imposition of monetary penalty on the Noticee under the provisions of Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act which reads as under SEBI Act Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder— ... b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty which shall No be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees;\n....

to another as explained hereinabove due to death of  Mr Manmal Thard.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of Nidhi Granites Limited File Ref No.\nEAD2 SS VS 37 7784 201819 ii.\nI have considered the allegations levelled against the Noticees the submissions of the Noticees No.1 to 7 and the relevant material available on record.\nIn this case it is admitted fact that the acquisitions of 25675 shares of the NGL by  Mr Rajkumar Manmal Thard and 47400 shares by Ms. Puhpa Rajkumar Thard were pursuant to rearrangement of shareholding amongst the family members consequent to the death of respective promoters Trustee namely Ms. Trivenidevi Manmal Thard and  Mr Manmal Thard respectively.\nThe arrangement of shares in the name of  Mr Rajkumar Manmal Thard on July 19 2010 and by Ms. Pushpa Rajkumar Thard on September 28 2010 were pursuant to transmission of those shares.\nI note that the obligation under regulation 33 of the SAST Regulations applies in case of acquisitions under regulation 31e h and i of the SAST Regulations.\nFurther the obligation under the regulation 34 of the SAST Regulations to file report with the Board applies in respect of regulation 31 a b e and i of

VS 37 7784 201819 in respect of this allegation.\nHence the matter cannot proceeded under section 15H ii of the SEBI Act with regard to this allegation.\nComing to the second limb of the charge i.e  the alleged failures in compliance of the disclosure obligations it is noted that the allegation is that the Noticees No 1 had No made disclosure in terms of regulation 71 read with regulation 72 of the SAST Regulations and under regulation 133 of the PIT Regulations with regard to his acquisition dated July 19 2010 and Noticee No 2 had No made disclosure in terms of regulation 133 of the PIT Regulations with regard to her acquisition dated September 28 2010 .\nIn terms of regulation 71 read with regulation 72 of the SAST Regulations any acquirer who acquires shares or voting right which would entitle him to more than 5% or 10% or 14% or 54% or 74% shares or voting rights in a accompany in any manner whatsoever shall disclose at every stage that aggregate his shareholding or voting rights in that Company to the Company and to the Stock Exchange where shares of the Company are listed within two days of receipt of the acquisitions of shares.\nSimilarly in terms of regulation 133 of the PIT Regulations a person who holds more than 5% shares in any listed Company is under obligation to make disclosures in specified Form C to the Company in case of any change in his shareholding and such change exceeds 2% of total shareholding or voting rights in the Company.\nIt is noted that provisions of regulation 133 of the PIT Regulations and provisions of regulation 71 read with regulation 72 of the SAST Regulations are similar as regards disclosure obligation of the acquirer is mandated to the Company.\nIn this case the acquisition of Noticee No 1 dated July 19 2010 triggered the threshold of 14% shareholding increase from 12.10 to% 15.52% under regulation 71 and he was required to make requisite disclosures to NGL and BSE within 2 working days from July 19 2010 as stipulated in regulation 72 of the SAST Regulations and to also to the Company in Form C specified in regulation 133 of the PIT Regulations.\nSimilarly pursuant to the acquisition dated September 28 2010 shareholding of the Noticee No 2 changed from 14.65% to 20.97% which triggered her obligation to make requisite disclosure in Form C to the Company under regulation 133 of the PIT Regulations.\nEAD2 SS VS 37 7784 201819 any person who succeeded to shares by way of operation of law can be treated as shareholder representing the estate of deceased shareholder.\nFurther Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal hereinafter referred to as ‘SAT’ in the matter of Mrs. Devyani Chandrakant Doshi Vs.\nIn Mrs. Devyani Chandrakant Doshi’s case the Adjudicating Officer of SEBI had imposed monetary penalty upon Mrs. Devyani Chandrakant Doshi for making delayed disclosures about her acquisition of shares in Rajoo Engineers Ltd by way of transmission of shares from her husband since deceased.\nIn appeal filed by the said Mrs. Devyani Chandrakant Doshi Hon’ble SAT remanded back the matter to the Adjudicating Officer who later by an order dated March 24 2015 held that the charge against said Mrs. Devyani Chandrakant Doshi was No established and exonerated her.\nFrom the Shareholding pattern of the NGL as on September 2010 as available on BSE website it is noted that change in shareholding of the Noticees No 1 and 2 pursuant to aforesaid arrangement of transmission of share have been disclosed in public domain as on September 30 2010 within a reasonable time and without creating any information asymmetry to the detriment of investors and securities market.\nThe SCN is disposed of accordingly.\nIn terms of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules copies of this order

material available on record.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 12.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the present case are  a.\nWhether the Noticee had violated the provisions of regulation 71 read with regulation 72 regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations regulation 131 and regulation 133 read with regulation 135 of the PIT Regulations and regulations 412abeandg of the PFUTP

cause fluctuations in the price of such security for wrongful gain or avoidance of loss; c ... d ... e any act or omission amounting to manipulation of the price of a security; f ... g entering into a transaction in securities without intention of performing it or without intention of change of ownership of such security.\nUpon careful perusal of the charges made against the Noticee and the material available on record I find the following Alleged violation of regulation 10 of SAST Regulations 14.\nUpon analysis of the demat account statements of entities belonging to promotergroup of IPL I find that on January 8 2004 and January 09 2004 1 Arjunlal N Uttamchandani 2 Nileshkumar G Uttamchandani 3 Sureshkumar N Uttamchandani 4 Maheshkumar N Uttamchandani 5 Shankerlal N Uttamchandani

referred to as ‘promoter group’ transferred 3077200 shares constituting 55.38% of the equity capital of the company to Right Finstock Private Limited hereinafter referred to as ‘RFPL’ and the Noticee through off market transactions.\nUpon perusal of documents available on record I find that 1663000 shares constituting 29.93% of the equity capital of the company were transferred by the promoter group to the Noticee and 1414200 shares constituting 25.45% of the equity capital of the company were transferred to RFPL.\nThe details of the transactions through which 1663000 shares constituting 29.93% of the equity capital of the company was transferred to the Noticee which increased the shareholding of the Noticee are given below Date of Transfer Transferor Transferee No of Shares % January

received back 2423296 shares being 43.61% of the equity capital of the company from RFPL and the Noticee.\nFrom January to July 2004 RFPL and the Noticee collectively offloaded 653904 shares in the market.\nOn February 20 July 05 July 07 and July 09 2004 Noticee retransferred 1457396 shares constituting 26.23% of the shares of IPL to the promoter group.\nThe details of the transactions by which the shares were retransferred are given below Date of Transfer Transferor Transferee No of Shares % February 20 2004 Noticee Shri Shailesh G Uttamchandani 35800 0.64 July 05 2004 Noticee Shri Sureshkumar N Uttamchandani 113300 2.03 July 07 2004 Noticee Shri.\nSureshkumar N Uttamchandani 409200 7.37 July 07 2004 Noticee Shri Nilesh G Uttamchandani 232800 4.19 July 07 2004 Noticee Shri

N Uttamchandani 109396 1.97 Total 1457396 26.23 The aforesaid transfers reduced the shareholding of the Noticee from 29.93% to 3.70% of the total shares of IPL 17.\nI note that in terms of Section 10 of the Depositories Act 1996 the beneficial owner is the person whose name is recorded as such with a depository and is entitled to all the rights and benefits and also subjected to all liabilities in respect of its securities held by a depository.\nAs per Section 413 of the Companies Act 1956 every person holding shares of a company and whose name is entered as beneficial owner in the records of the depository shall be deemed to be a member of the concerned company.\nFurther as per Section 152A of the said Act the register and index of beneficial owners maintained by a depository under section 11 of the Depositories Act 1996 shall be deemed to be an index of members and register and index of debenture holders as the case may be.\nFurther any transfer of securities from the beneficial owner account would be construed as change in ownership in respect of those securities which have been transferred to another beneficiary account.\nI find that the promoter group had transferred a total of 1663000 shares constituting 29.93% of share capital of IPL which were in demat form in favour of the Noticee on January 08 and January 09 2004 and Noticee retransferred a total of 1457396 shares constituting 26.23% of share capital of IPL on February 20 July 07 July 09 and July 10 2004 to the promoter group which indicates that the ownership of the shares had been transferred in the names of the parties.\nI find that the parties became the rightful owners of the said shares in IPL.\nIn view of this the acquisition of 29.93% shares on January 08 and January 09 2004 by the Noticee is more than the threshold limit specified under regulation 10 of SAST Regulations and therefore Noticee ought to have made a public announcement.\nIn view of the foregoing I am convinced that it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under section15H ii of the SEBI Act.\nThe provisions of section 15Hii of SEBI Act is reproduced hereunder 15H.\nPenalty for nondisclosure of acquisition of shares and takeovers If any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder fails to  i.... ii make a public announcement to acquire shares at a minimum price; or he shall be liable to a penalty of twenty five crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of such failure whichever is higher.\nAlleged violation of regulation 71 read with regulation 72 of SAST Regulations 21.\nRegulation 71 read with regulation 72 of SAST Regulations deals with disclosure of number and percentage of shares voting rights to the company by an acquirer who acquires shares or voting rights which taken together with shares or voting rights if any held by him would entitle him to more than 5% shares or voting rights in a company in any manner whatsoever within two working days of  viz. the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares as well as the acquisition of shares or voting rights as the case may be.\nIn the instant case I find that on January 08 2004 and January 09 2004 the Noticee acquired 1663000 shares from the promoter group constituting 29.93% of the total shares of IPL.\nOn January 08 2004 Noticee acquired 1653000 shares constituting 29.75% of the total shares of IPL and on January 09 2004 the Noticee acquired 10000 shares constituting 0.18% of the total shares of IPL.\nThe acquisition on January 08 2004 is more than the 5% threshold specified in regulation 71 of SAST Regulations.\nThe due date for compliance under regulations 71 and 72 of SAST Regulations was January 12 2004.\nAlleged violation of regulation 131 and regulation 133 read with regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 23.\nIn terms of regulations 131 of PIT Regulations any person who holds more than 5% shares or voting rights in any listed company shall disclose to the company the number of shares or voting rights held by such person on becoming such holder within 4 working days of— a the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares; or b the acquisition of shares or voting rights as the case may be.\nIn the instant case as on January 08 2004 with the transfer of 1653000 shares from the promoter group the shareholding of the Noticee increased by 29.75%.\nThe Noticee was required to comply with regulation 131 of PIT Regulations which mandates disclosure by any person who holds more than 5% shares or voting rights in any listed company.\nThe due date for compliance was January 14 2004.\nIn terms of regulation 133 of PIT Regulations any person who holds more than 5% of shares or voting rights in a listed company is required to disclose to the company the number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights under two circumstances as detailed below If such change results in shareholding falling below 5% If there has been change in such holdings from the last disclosure made under regulation 131 or under regulation 133 and such change exceeds 2% of total shareholding or voting rights in the company.\nIn terms of regulation 135 of PIT Regulations the disclosure mentioned in subregulations 3 and 4 shall be made within 4 working days of a the receipts of intimation of allotment of shares or b the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights as the case may be.\nIn the instant case as on January 08 with the transfer of 1653000 shares from the promoter group the shareholding of the Noticee increased by 29.75%.\nThe Noticee was required to make a disclosure under regulation 133 read with regulation 135 of PIT Regulations to the company i.e  IPL as there was a change in the shareholding exceeding 2% of the total shares of the company.\nThe due date for compliance was January 14 2004.\nThe Noticee did No make the disclosure.\nWith the transfer of 113300 shares to the promoter group on July 05 2004 the shareholding of the Noticee reduced by 2.03%.\nThe Noticee was required to make a disclosure to IPL under regulation 133 read with regulation 135 of PIT Regulations as there was a change in the shareholding exceeding 2% of the total shares of the company.\nThe due date for compliance was July 09 2004.\nThe Noticee did No make the disclosure.\nWith the transfer of 1198900 shares to the promoter group on July 07 2004 the shareholding of the Noticee reduced by 21.59%.The Noticee was required to make a disclosure to IPL under regulation 133 read with regulation 135 of PIT Regulations as there was a change in the shareholding exceeding 2% of the total shares of the company.\nThe due date for compliance was July 13 2004.\nThe Noticee did No make the disclosure.\nWith the transfer of 109396 shares on July 10 2004 the shareholding of the Noticee reduced by 1.97% to 3.70% .\nThe Noticee was required to make a disclosure to IPL under regulation 133 read with regulation 135 of PIT Regulations i.e  as there was a change in the shareholding falling below 5% of the total shares of the company.\nThe due date for compliance was July 15 2004.\nThe Noticee did No make the disclosure.\nIn view of the foregoing I am convinced that it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under section15A b of the SEBI Act.\nThe provisions of section 15A b of SEBI Act is reproduced hereunder 15A.\nPenalty for failure to furnish information return etc. If any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder  a... b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefore in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefore in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.\nWhile determining the quantum of monetary penalty under section 15Hii and section 15Ab  I have considered the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under “15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.”\nOn perusal of the various provisions of the SAST Regulations it is observed that the open offer process includes appointment of a SEBI registered merchant banker as manager to the offer determination of offer size and price opening of an escrow account making public announcement in newspapers filing of offer document with SEBI dispatch of offer document to the eligible share holders etc. By No having complied with the mandatory requirement of the SAST Regulations the Noticee has avoided the expenditure which otherwise they would have incurred towards cost of engaging the services of a Merchant Banker making public announcement in newspapers filing of offer document with SEBI dispatch of offer document to the eligible share holders etc. 34.\nAlleged violation of regulation 412abeandg of PFUTP Regulations 35.\nThe scrip of IPL was listed at Bombay Stock Exchange BSE Ahmedabad Stock Exchange ASE and Vadodara Stock Exchange VSE however during the period of investigation i.e  December 05 2003 to January 28 2004 it got traded at BSE only.\nThe price volume data recorded at BSE during the period of investigation is as below Face Value Rs 10 Exchange Open High Low Close Volume BSE 1.93 5 12 2003 14.40 16 1 2004 1.55 8 12 2003 6.38 28 1 2004 838426 36.\nThe shares of the company were trading irregularly and the price was in the range of 0.98 to 2.82 before the investigation period.\nDuring the investigation period the shares of the company were traded on the BSE in 32 days for 838426 shares and the share price had increased from 1.93 to reach the peak of 14.40 on January 16 2004.\nNoticee is a member of ASE and its SEBI Registration Nos. is INB021135737.\nNoticee received 1663000 shares 29.93%of paid up capital from the promoters on January 08 and January 09 2004.\nHowever from the documents available on record I find that the Noticee started trading in the market from January 15 2004.\nNoticee traded in the scrip of IPL through the broker Ruchiraj Shares and Stock Brokers Private Limited RSSBPL and bought 56339 shares 6.72% of the market volume and sold 111993 shares 13.36% of the market volume.\nThe same can be depicted from the table below Broker

quantities.\nAt the same time it started buying shares from January 16 2004.\nDay wise sell and buy volume of Noticee was ranging from 1.51% to 41.76%.\nFrom January 15 2004 after the Board meeting of IPL on Jan14 2004 it started selling the shares in the market.\nOn January 16 2004 company announced the results and on that day price of the scrip of IPL touched its highest of 14.40. • Noticee sold major shares on January 15 and 16 2004.\nOn net basis Noticee sold 55654 shares during the investigation period.\nIt placed large buy orders which were subsequently deleted.\nIn July 2004 after the investigation period Noticee retransferred 1457396 shares 26.63% to promoters.\nFrom January to July 2004 RFPL and Noticee collectively offloaded 653904 shares of IPL in market 177432 shares were offloaded during the period of investigation.\nFrom the material available on record I find that during the period of investigation Noticee traded through the broker RSSBPL.\nIt placed large buy orders which were subsequently deleted.\nTotal 81 buy orders were placed for 192000 shares on 8 days and out of that 25 orders for 127511 were deleted on 6 days.\nOn a perusal of the price volume data I find that the share price of the company was gradually increasing even prior to the transfer of shares by the promoters to the aforesaid entities and their subsequent trading.\nThe share price of the company as on December 05 2003 was 1.93. Thereafter the share price gradually increased from 1.93 to 12.24 on January 07 2004.\nThe promoter group had transferred the shares to the Noticee on January 08 2004 and January 09 2004.\nPursuant to the said transfers the share price gradually increased from 12.24 to 14.40 i.e  an increase of 17.65%.\nThe increase in the share price during December 05 2003 to January 07 2004 was accompanied by low traded volumes as compared to the period between January 08 2004 and January 28 2004.\nThe share price was at it peak at 14.40 on January 16 2004.\nThe shares were traded on January 16 2004 between 12.53 and 14.40.\nThe share price had fallen thereafter during the period of investigation.\nTherefore the substantial increase in the share price had happened prior to January 08 and January 09 2004 before the Noticee had traded in the shares of the company.\nThe major volume in the shares was observed on January 15 and January 16 2004.\nNoticee received 1663000 shares from the promoter group through off market transactions.\nNoticee bought 56339 shares 6.72% of the trading volume and sold 111993 shares 13.36% of the trading volume through RSSBPL on the floor of the stock exchange.\nTherefore it cannot be said that Noticee had offloaded the shares received from the promoter group for the purpose of creating volume.\nFurther there is no material to support the nature of the trades executed by the Noticee.\nRegulation 4 1 prohibits a person from indulging in fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities.\nRegulation 42a of PFUTP Regulations prohibits a person from indulging in an act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market.\nRegulation 42b of PFUTP Regulations prohibits dealings in a security intended to operate as a device to inflate depress or cause fluctuations in the price of such security for wrongful gains.\nRegulation 42e prohibits any act or omission amounting to manipulation of the price of a security.\nRegulation 42g of PFUTP Regulations prohibits from entering into a transaction in securities without intention of performing it or without intention of change of ownership of such security.\nThere is no material on record to establish the alleged manipulative role played by the Noticee.\nThere has to be some corroborative material on record to prove the allegation of manipulation.\nAfter taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case and material available on record I hereby impose a monetary penalty of 500000 Rupees Five Lac Only  under section 15H ii and 100000 Rupees One Lac Only  under section 15Ab of the Act {i.e  a total penalty of 600000  Rupees Six Lac only  } on the Noticee which will be commensurate with the default committed by it.\nThe Noticee shall pay the said amount of penalty by way of demand draft in favour of “SEBI Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai within 45 days of receipt of this order.\nThe said demand draft shall be forwarded to  Mr Ashish Kumar Deputy General Manager Investigations Department Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI Bhavan Plot No C4A “G” Block Bandra Kurla Complex Bandra East Mumbai–400 051.\nIn terms of rule 6 of the Rules copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.\nDate October 27 2010 PARAG BASU Place MUMBAI ADJUDICATING OFFICER","In view of the foregoing I am convinced that it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under section15H ii of the SEBI Act.In view of the foregoing I am convinced that it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under section15A b of the SEBI Act.Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. If any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder  a... b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefore in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefore in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.After taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case and material available on record I hereby impose a monetary penalty of 500000 Rupees Five Lac Only  under section 15H ii and 100000 Rupees One Lac Only  under section 15Ab of the Act {i.e  a total penalty of 600000  Rupees Six Lac only  } on the Noticee which will be commensurate with the default committed by it.", " 15G"))

notice the Honble High Court of Madras vide its interim order dated December 16 2005 restrained SEBI from proceeding further to the show cause notice.\nThis restraint order was passed by the Honble High Court on the premise that the noticee had prima facie No done the alleged insider trading.\nWhile the Writ Petition was pending and the interim order passed by the Honble High Court was in operation the noticee applied for settlement of the adjudication proceedings through a consent order by SEBI under the consent process.\nSEBI accepted his settlement terms.\nBefore passing the Consent Order SEBI had informed the Hon’bIe High Court at Madras on 11th June 2008 that the High Powered Advisory Committee of SEBI has recommended that the whole case be settled by way of Consent Order and the Honble High Court thereupon dismissed the Writ Petitions on request in view of the settlement through consent order.\nAccordingly settlement amount of 700000  was deposited by the noticee pursuant to the agreed consent terms. d.\nThe Adjudicating Officer of SEBI accordingly passed Consent Order dated 21 7 2008 as following 6.\nThe SCN has been issued after the whole case has been finally settled by the above order which has been passed with regard to the same charges and allegations and under the same facts and circumstances.\nThe SCN is also hit by the provisions of section 26 of General Clause Act 1897.\nI have considered the SCN the replies and submissions of the noticee and other material available on record.\nBefore dealing with the charges and allegations it is necessary to examine the arguments submissions of the noticee with regard to the maintainability of the SCN.\nThe civil enforcement actions in the cases that are before hand include directions under section 11 and 11B of the SEBI Act and imposition of monetary penalty under the adjudication proceedings under Chapter VIA of the said Act.\nThe criminal action is by way of prosecution under section 24 of the SEBI Act.\nI note that in the instant case pursuant to completion of investigation in the matter of Polaris Software Lab Ltd. the Board contemplated both the civil actions i.e  adjudication proceedings under section 15G and also issue appropriate directions under section 11B of the SEBI Act read with regulation 11 of the PIT Regulations against the noticee.\nThe Adjudicating Officer issued the show cause notice No EAD PG 50892 2005 dated September 30 2005 under the adjudication proceedings.\nThough the proceedings under section 11B were also decided and contemplated in 2005 no show cause notice with regard to the same was issued till December 26 2011 when the present SCN was issued.\nI note that the consent order dated July 21 2008 clearly declared that it disposed of the adjudication proceedings pending against the noticee.\nThe consent order has been passed by an Adjudicating Officer disposing of the adjudication proceedings on the basis of the consent terms.\nAs mentioned above such proceedings had been contemplated in 2005 itself i.e  much before the settlement of the Adjudication Proceedings through consent order dated July 21 2008.\nI also note that the Honble High Court of Madras had No decided the matter on merit rather had dismissed the writ petition filed by the noticee as nothing remained to be adjudicated as the Adjudication Proceedings were agreed to be settled through consent order.\nSection 26 of The General Clauses Act 1897 provides that S. 26.\nProvisions as to offences punishable under two or more enactments.\nWhere an act or omission constitutes an offence under two or more enactments then the offender shall be liable to be prosecuted and punished under either or any of those enactments but shall No be liable to be punished twice for the same offence.\nThis section applies when an act or omission is an offence under two or more enactments.\nThis section prohibits punishment for the same offence twice under different enactments.\nThe penalty leviable under this Chapter or under these sections is penalty in cases of default or failure of statutory obligation or in other words breach of civil obligation.\nHaving addressed the aforesaid contentions of the noticee I No proceed to deal with the merits of the case.\nThe provisions of the SEBI Act and PIT Regulations which are alleged to have been violated by the noticee and are relevant for the case are reproduced below SEBI Act.\nFunctions of the Board.\n1 Subject to the provision of this Act it shall be the duty of the Board to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of and to regulate the securities market by such measures as it thinks fit.\n2 Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions the measures referred to therein may provide for  g prohibiting insider trading in securities Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control.\nNo person shall directly or indirectly a.\nSEBI Insider Trading Regulations 1993 as it stood during the year 2000 Prohibition on dealing communicating or counselling on matters relating to insider trading.\nRegulation 3.\nNo insider shall— i either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person deal in securities of a company listed on any stock exchange on the basis of any unpublished price sensitive information; or ii communicate any unpublished price sensitive information to any person with or without his request for such information except as required in the ordinary course of business or under any law; or iii counsel or procure any other person to deal in securities of any company on the basis of unpublished price sensitive information.\nDirections by the Board.— Regulation 11.\nOn receipt of the explanation if any from the insider under subregulation 2 of regulation 9 the Board may without prejudice to its right to initiate criminal prosecution under section 24 of the Act give such directions to protect the interest of investors and in the interest of the securities market and for due compliance with the provisions of the Act rules made thereunder and these regulations as it deems fit for all or any of the following purposes namely — a directing the insider No to deal in securities in any particular manner; b prohibiting the insider from disposing of any of the securities acquired in violation of these regulations; c restraining the insider to communicate or counsel any person to deal in securities 14.\nI note that the alleged violation had occurred during the year 2000 whereas sections 12Ad and e of the SEBI Act 1992 came into force with effect from October 29 2002.\nI therefore proceed to deal with charges levelled against the noticee in the SCN within the scope and ambit of section 11 1 & 2 11B of the SEBI Act and PIT Regulations as they existed at the time of alleged violation.\nIn order to establish the charge it is necessary to prove that the noticee was an  insider and whether he dealt in securities of the company on the basis of any unpublished price sensitive information as alleged in the SCN.\nIn terms of regulation 2e of the PIT an “‘insider’ means any person who is or was connected with the company or is deemed to have been connected with the company and who is reasonably expected to have access by virtue of such connection to unpublished price sensitive information in respect of securities of the company or who has received or has had access to such unpublished price sensitive information.”\nA person to be considered as insider should be one who is or was actually connected with the company or deemed to have been connected with the company.\nThe term “connected person” has been defined in regulation 2c and includes any person who is a “director” of a company as defined in clause 13 of section 2 of the Companies Act 1956.\nThere is no dispute as to fact that the noticee was a promoter and the Chairman and Managing Director of the company during the relevant time.\nThe noticee had admitted during the investigation that as the CEO CMD of the company he was responsible for the growth of the company and for defining the strategic roadmap of the company and that as the CMD of the company he was involved in most of the stages of the acquisition process except negotiations where the committee of experts played a critical role.\nHowever he had further clarified that outside experts have an advisory role in acquisition matters as they “help in validating the facts provided by the prospective entity against the real situation”.\nThe next question that arises is what was the unpublished price sensitive information in this case.\nThe term “unpublished price sensitive information” has been defined in regulation 2k of the PIT regulations as under ‐ ‘ 2.kUnpublished Price Sensitive Information’ means any information which relates to the following matters or is of concern directly or indirectly to a company and is No generally known or published by such company for general information but which if published or known is likely to materially affect the price of securities of that company in the market – i financial results both halfyearly and annual of the company; ii intended declaration of dividends both interim final; iii issue of shares by way of public rights bonus etc.; iv any major expansion plans or execution of new projects; v amalgamation mergers and takeovers; vi disposal of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking; vii such other information as may affect the earnings of the company; viii any changes in policies plans or operations of the company.\nIn this case it is noted that the process for the proposed acquisition of Data Inc. by the company began with the signing of the MoU between the company and Data Inc. and ratification thereof by the Board of the company during April May 2000.\nPandya Kapadia & Associates CPA and KPMG and who were assigned the work of related Tax and Accounts of Data Inc. and due diligence respectively submitted their report on July 17 2000 and August 07 2000 to the company highlighting serious discrepancies with regard to the proposed acquisition.\nThe company had undertaken the process of acquisition of Data Inc. under the ‘Fast Track’ route of acquisition prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India wherein the entire acquisition had to be completed within a period of 90 days i.e  by August 23 2000.\nHowever on September 30 2000 the Audit Committee of the company recommended that the acquisition of Data Inc in its proposed form would No be in the best interests of the shareholders of the company.\nAccordingly the proposal was called off.\nThe information relating to calling off the proposed acquisition of Data Inc. was brought in public domain when the company informed the concerned stock exchanges on September 30 2000.\nI note that when the company disclosed the above information to the stock exchanges on September 30 2000 there was a decline in the price of its shares.\nFor instance the closing price of the scrip at NSE on September 29 2000 was 595 which went down to 545 on the next day of trade on October 03 2000 September 30 and October 01 2000 being Saturday and Sunday respectively and October 02 2000 being trading holiday and touched a intraday low of 519.80 on the same day.\nIn the month of October 2000 there was a rapid fall in the price of the scrip which went down as low as 390 on October 23 2000.\nTherefore the fact that the proposed acquisition was No in the interest of the shareholders of the company and it was No likely to be completed by August 23 2000 and was to be called off was clearly an unpublished price sensitive information as per regulation 2kv till September 30 2000.\nIt is noted that the noticee had access to all information relating to the proposed acquisition of Data Inc. since the noticee had participated in the events relating to the proposed acquisition.\nI therefore find that the said unpublished price sensitive information was known and available only to the insiders like the noticee and No to the public till September 30 2000.\nThe noticee had admitted during investigation that he had instructed his Chartered Accountant  Mr Sivasubramanian to sell around 15000 shares of the company for the purpose of purchasing a plot in Gurgaon in Haryana.\nI note that PHPL wherein the noticee was director during the relevant time sold 15080 shares of the company through Allsec at an average price of 700 per share in settlement No 35 36 37 and 38 from August 23 2000 to September 19 2000 on NSE details of which is as follows Settlement No Dates Shares Sold 35 23.08.2000  29.08.2000 500 36 30.08.2000  05.09.2000 7000 37 06.09.2000  12.09.2000 6080 38 13.09.2000  19.09.2000 1500 Total 15080 24.\nA table showing the share price from August 23 2000 to September 19 2000 is given below Date Price   Date Price   23Aug2000 641 7Sept2000 718 24Aug2000 629 8Sept2000 766 25Aug2000 632 11Sept2000 748 28Aug2000 620 12Sept2000

investigations the noticee had submitted that the shares were sold before August 25 2000 when there was complete confidence of going ahead with deal of acquisition M s Data Inc. Further the shares were sold for the purpose of acquisition of an industrial plot in Gurgaon which was allotted to PHPL by Haryana State Industrial Corporation Ltd HSIDC vide allotment letter dated March 01 2000.\nI note that information about serious discrepancies with regard to the proposed acquisition expiry of last date for completion of acquisition on August 23 2000 and that the proposal was No likely to be completed after that date was available with the noticee when he dealt in the scrip.\nThe sale orders were placed on various dates in Settlement No 35 to 38 at NSE falling between August 23 2000 and September 19 2000.\nThe last order for sale of 1500 shares was placed on September 13 2000.\nI note on September 15 2000 and September 23 2000 total funds to the tune of 9018000 were received in the bank account of PHPL from Allsec.\nOut of these funds PHPL purchased a fixed deposit for 5000000 on September 26 2000 and the balance amount was used for repayment of money taken earlier from related account A c No 0041000057134.\nThe noticee had also submitted during investigations that the quantity of share sold 15080 shares by him is very small as compared to his PHPLs shareholding 1.5 crore shares in the company.\nI note that in the SCN it has been alleged that the noticee by the trading on behalf of PHPL in 15080 shares of the company had made unfair gains to the tune of 27.26 lakhs.\nSEBI Appeal No 209 of 2011;\nThe noticee and Mrs. Manju Jain were the directors of PHPL when the shares were sold.\nFurther the shares were sold at the instruction of the noticee when he was in possession of unpublished price sensitive information about the company.\nI note that for this reason it was contemplated to initiate multiple proceedings against the noticee in 2005.\nHowever I note that at the relevant time only the adjudication proceedings under section 15G of the SEBI Act were initiated.\nAt that time the maximum monetary penalty by adjudication under section 15G of the SEBI Act was 5 lakhs.\nIn this case the adjudication proceedings initiated under section 15G were settled on payment of 7 lakhs through consent order date July 21 2008.\nTill that date SCN under sections 11 and 11B of the SEBI Act was No issued.\nThe present SCN was issued belatedly on December 26 2011 i.e  after more than 6 years after the decision in that regard was taken and after more than 3 years of the disposal of the adjudication proceedings.\nConsidering the facts and circumstances of this case seriousness of violations and the above mitigating factors I in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under section 19 read with sections 111 and 11B of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992 and regulation 11 of the SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 I hereby restrain  Mr Arun Jain PAN  AAHPJ6020E from accessing the securities market and further prohibit him from buying selling or otherwise dealing in securities directly or indirectly or being associated with the securities market in any manner for a period of two years from the date of this order.\nShow Cause Notice dated December 26 2011 issued to the noticee is accordingly disposed of.\nA copy of this order shall be served on all recognized stock exchanges and depositories to ensure that the direction given in para 31 of this Order are complied with.\nThis Order shall come into force with immediate effect.\nDate  October 9th 2012 RAJEEV KUMAR AGARWAL Place  Mumbai WHOLE TIME MEMBER SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA","At that time the maximum monetary penalty by adjudication under section 15G of the SEBI Act was 5 lakhs.Considering the facts and circumstances of this case seriousness of violations and the above mitigating factors I in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under section 19 read with sections 111 and 11B of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992 and regulation 11 of the SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 I hereby restrain  Mr Arun Jain PAN  AAHPJ6020E from accessing the securities market and further prohibit him from buying selling or otherwise dealing in securities directly or indirectly or being associated with the securities market in any manner for a period of two years from the date of this order.", "I note that in the instant case pursuant to completion of investigation in the matter of Polaris Software Lab Ltd. the Board contemplated both the civil actions i.e  adjudication proceedings under section 15G and also issue appropriate directions under section 11B of the SEBI Act read with regulation 11 of the PIT Regulations against the noticee."))

the current Adjudication proceedings were kept on hold until determination of the issue of applicability of Section 15J to Sections 15Aa b and c 15B 15C 15D 15E 15Fb& c 15G 15H and 15HA of the SEBI

other Noticees reiterated that the Noticees were one promoter group and requested to consider the written oral submissions that have been placed on record during the adjudication proceedings.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of Safari Industries India Limited CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES 22.\nI have carefully perused the written submissions of the Noticees the submission made at the personal hearings and the documents available on record.\nIt is observed that the allegation against the Noticees is that they had failed to make the relevant disclosure under the provisions of Regulation 82 of the Takeover Regulations for the financial year ended March 31 2006 within the stipulated time.\nThe issues that therefore arise for consideration in the present case are i.\nWhether the Promoter Noticees were required to make the relevant disclosure under the provisions of Regulation 82 of the Takeover Regulations for the financial year ended March 31 2006? ii.\nIf so whether the Promoter Noticees have violated the provision of Regulation 82 of the Takeover Regulations for the financial year ended March 31 2006? iii.\nIf so whether the Promoter Noticees were individual promoters or did they constitute ‘Promoter group’ acting in concert under the Takeover Regulations? iv.\nDoes the violation if any attract monetary penalty under Section 15 Ab of SEBI Act? v.\nIf so what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act?\nBefore moving forward it is pertinent to refer to the provisions of Regulation 82 of Takeover Regulations which reads as under Regulation 82 of Takeover Regulations Continual disclosures.\n2 A promoter or every person having control over a company shall within 21 days from the financial year ending March 31 as well as the record date of the company for the purposes of declaration of dividend disclose the number and percentage of shares or Adjudication Order in the matter of Safari Industries India Limited voting rights held by him and by persons acting in concert with him in that company to the company.\nThe first issue for consideration is whether the promoter Noticees were required to make the relevant disclosure under the provisions of Regulation 82 of the Takeover Regulations for the financial year ended March 31 2006.\nI find from the Shareholding Pattern of the Promoter group as available on BSE’s website that the Noticees were the promoters of the company at the relevant point of time.\nThe Noticees I find in their submissions have also admitted that they were a part of the promoters promoter group of the company.\nFurther I find that as per Regulation 82 of the Takeover Regulations a promoter or every person having control over a company is required within 21 days from the financial year ending March 31 as well as the record date of the company for the purposes of declaration of dividend disclose the number and percentage of shares or voting rights held by him and by persons acting in concert with him in that company to the company.\nThe next issue for consideration is whether the Noticees have violated the provisions of Regulations 82 of the Takeover Regulations for the financial year ended March 31 2006.\nI find that the SCN alleged that the disclosure under Regulation 82 of the Takeover Regulations were made by the Noticees to the company only on April 28 2006 details of which are at para 7 above.\nFrom the table at para 7 above it is observed that for the financial year 2006 the due date for compliance by the promoter Noticees as per the Takeover Regulations was April 21 2006.\nShri Amul Mehta vide reply dated December 16 2013 to the SCN on behalf of himself and on behalf of the other Noticees has inter alia admitted that the Noticees for the financial year ending March 31 2006 had made the disclosure under Regulation 82 of the Takeover Regulations only on April 28 2006 against the due date of April 21 2006 i.e  with a delay of 7 days.\nThus I note that the Noticees have specifically admitted the delay of 7 days in making the disclosures under Regulation 82 of the Takeover Regulations for the financial year ending March 31 2006.\nThus I find that the Noticees have Adjudication Order in the matter of Safari Industries India Limited admitted the violation of Regulation 82 of the Takeover Regulations for the financial year ended March 31 2006.\nI further note that vide written submissions dated February 19 2015 the Noticee Shri Amul Mehta on his own behalf and on behalf of the other Noticees has inter alia stated that the action to hold each Noticee severally liable for the same violation under Regulation 82 of the Takeover Regulation is harsh and inconsistent with the earlier decisions taken by SEBI SAT in similar cases.\nI find here that the Noticees have made a mention of the Adjudicating Order dated November 27 2009 in the case of Shri Anil Kumar Sharda in the matter of Jaihind Synthetics Ltd hereinafter referred to as ‘JSL’.\nHowever in light of the Order of the Hon’ble SAT dated November 20 2015 in the matter at hand I note that the said issue has already been determined.\nThe next issue that arises is whether the Promoter Noticees were individual promoters or do they constitute ‘promoter group’ acting in concert under the Takeover Regulations.\nI find that the Noticees during the hearing dated November 25 2016 have referred to Annexure C of Noticees letter dated January 15 2014.\nUpon examination of the said Annexure C to letter dated January 15 2014 I find that the same is a copy of the disclosure dated April 28 2006 made under Regulation 82 of Takeover Regulations for shareholding as on March 31 2006.\nIn view of the foregoing I am convinced that it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act which reads as under Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder— b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefore in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefore in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of Safari Industries India Limited 34.\nWhile determining the quantum of monetary penalty under Section 15 Ab I have considered the factors stipulated in Section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under “15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under Section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nIn view of the charges as established the facts and circumstances of the case and the judgments referred to and mentioned hereinabove the quantum of penalty would depend on the factors referred in Section 15J of SEBI Act and stated as above.\n1 Inserted by Part VIII of Chapter VI of the Finance Act 2017 vide Gazette Notification No 7 Extraordinary Prt II Section 1 dated March 31 2017 wef April 26 2017 Adjudication Order in the matter of Safari Industries India Limited 36.\nAs per Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act the Noticee is liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.\nFurther under Section 15I of the SEBI Act the adjudicating officer has to give due regard to certain factors which have been stated as above while adjudging the quantum of penalty.\nI however note that the Honble Securities Appellate Tribumal SAT in the matter of Komal Nahata Vs.\nFurther the Noticees have submitted that there was no change in the shareholding of the Noticees with respect to the period in question.\nThe Noticees have stated that the information was available on the record of the company and the stock exchanges in view of the disclosure made by the company with BSE under clause 35 of the Listing Agreement as also disclosures made by the company under Regulation 83 of Takeover Regulations.\nThus the Noticee has stated that the investors were No deprived of the requisite information about shareholding of the Noticees during the period April 21 2006 due date of filing disclosure under Regulation 82 to April 28 2006 actual date of disclosure.\nI note that the Noticees have submitted before me the filing made to BSE under Clause 35 of the Listing Agreement for the quarter ending December 2005 and copy of the Shareholding Pattern Summary form for freefloat indices as on March 31 2006 copy of Controlling Strategic Holders form and copy of the form disclosing the holdings of 1% & above  filed by the company with BSE as on March 31 2006.\nI however note from the aforesaid documents produced before me that the shareholding of the Noticees for the quarter ended March 31 2006 was submitted by the company to BSE vide letter dated April 26 2006 which was acknowledged by BSE only on May 02 2006.\nI note here that the Noticees have also provided a copy of the disclosure dated April 11 2006 filed by the company with BSE in terms of Regulation 83 of the Takeover Regulations as on March 31 2006.\nOn perusal of the said copy I find that the Compliance Officer of the company had informed the Exchange that they were sending the details of shareholding obtained under Regulation 81 and 82 from the acquirers.\nFurther the filing made by the company under Regulation 83 mentioned “Shareholding Voting rights in number and % of persons mentioned at II as informed to the target company u r 82”.\nSince however the Noticees have admitted to have filed the disclosure under Regulation 82 of the Takeover Regulations with delay it becomes crystal clear that when the company filed the disclosure under Regulation 83 of the Takeover Regulations to the stock Exchange the company did No have the disclosures from the promoter Noticees under Regulation 82 of the Takeover Regulations.\nI find that the Noticees made a delayed disclosure to the company.\nThe delay in the instant case is by seven 7 days on one occasion for the financial year ended March 31 2006 with regards to making the relevant disclosure under the provisions of Regulation 82 of the Takeover Regulations to the Company.\nHowever it has No been discovered that the company while making the filing did No have the disclosures from the promoter Noticees under Regulation 82 of the Takeover Regulations.\nI further find that the Noticees have referred to the fact that the Adjudication Officer in the matter of  Mr Anil Kumar Sharda had imposed a penalty of Rs 15000  in the said matter.\nI Adjudication Order in the matter of Safari Industries India Limited however note here that the Hon’ble SAT vide Order dated February 18 2015 in the matter of Count N Denier India Ltd has upheld the penalty of Rs 2 lacs imposed on the promoter Shri Anil Agarwal therein for delay of five 5 days in making annual disclosure under Regulation 302 read with 303 of SEBI Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations 2011 for the year ended March 31 2012.\nAfter taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case I impose a total penalty of Rs 200000  Rupees Two lacs only under Section 15 Ab on the Noticees viz.\nShri Amul Sumatichandra Mehta Shri Yugesh Sumatichandra Mehta

acknowledged and admitted vide Notice dated 2182012 while revoking the suspension in trading of equity shares of the respondent company.\nThe aforesaid notice issued by the BSE categorically records that the Promoters’ shareholding i.e  944500 equity share shall remain in lock in period upto 31122012.\nA bare perusal of the shareholding pattern of the company would go to show that the aforesaid shares belong to  Mr Krishan Kumar Parwal and Sunita Parwal.\nThe aforesaid request of the company was accepted by the SEBI by observing that the company may No be required to obtain approval of the shareholders for the proposed reclassification.\nHowever such classification may be allowed by the Stock Exchanges as per the listing regulations subject to the compliance of Regulation 31A.\nThat the aforesaid change in the shareholding pattern was duly informed to the BSE vide letter dated 22112010 wherein the respondent company informed the BSE about the change in status from Promoter category to Public category.\nIt is pertinent to note that after the receipt of the aforesaid letter no query was raised by the BSE and therefore the respondent company remained under the impression that it had complied with all the provisions of the listing agreement as well as the SCRA.\nThat in 2010 the management of the company decided to apply for revocation of suspension of trading of equity shares to the BSE and accordingly an application was made to the BSE for revocation of suspension of trading of equity shares in 2011.\nThat in response to the application the BSE sought certain explanation on forfeiture of equity shares from the respondent company which were duly replied with by the respondent company.\nThat it is relevant to note that after the revocation of suspension of trading of equity shares by BSE the fact of change of status of Hansraj Parwal Basanti Devi Parwal Vinod Kumar Parwal Nirmala Devi Parwal Vinesh Kumar Bhargava and Ram Janki Devi Parwal is being displayed on the website of BSE and the shareholding pattern depicting change in Promoter category is being filed with BSE since October 2010 to till date.\nThat at the time of revocation of suspension of trading of equity shares by the BSE a condition was imposed by the BSE that the entire promoter’s holding of the company shall remain under lock in for a period of three months from the date of revocation.\nAs per the notice dated 21 82012 issued by the Department of Corporate Services BSE and the details of the Promoter’s shareholding which was directed to remain under lock – in period was the shareholding belonging to Krishan Kumar Parwal and his wife.\nThe aforesaid shareholding belonging to Krishan Kumar Parwal did No include the shareholding of the other family members who were reclassified in the public category in the year 2010.\nThat the respondent company was shocked to see the letter dated 06.08.2014 as to why the BSE has failed to inform to SEBI about the receipt of the letter dated 22.11.2010.\nHowever after the aforesaid letter was replied no more query was raised by SEBI regarding the change in category but by an email dated 26.08.2014 queries were raised regarding the forfeiture of the shares which was duly answered by the Respondent Company.\nIn view of the aforesaid submission the impugned Interim Order dated 1562016 may kindly be quashed and set aside.”\nWhether HRB Floriculture is No compliant with the requirement of minimum public shareholding as stipulated under Rule 192b and Rule 19A of the SCRR? b.\nWhether any other action as contemplated under the

Notifications was that all listed companies other than PSUs were mandated to have minimum public shareholding of 25%.\nFurther in listed companies where the public shareholding was less than 25% such companies were mandated to raise the same to the minimum of 25% by June 3 2013.\nIssuance of shares to public through prospectus; b.\nOffer for sale of shares held by Promoters to public through prospectus; c.\n1.8 The shareholding patterns of HRB Floriculture as obtained from the BSE website as on December 31 2016 is as under – TABLE IV PERIOD – DECEMBER 31 2016 SR.\nIt is therefore inferred

minimum public shareholding requirement.\n1.10 On a consideration of the aforementioned in light of the shareholding at Table IV it is observed that Promoters and persons related to the Promoters entities at serial No 3–7 of Table IV who were re–classified as ‘public shareholders’ continue to hold 90.06% of the total shareholding in HRB Floriculture see also paragraph 16 of the Interim Order

achieving compliance with minimum public shareholding requirement under Rule 19A of the Securities Contracts Regulation Rules 1957 and the provisions of these Regulations.”\n2.6 From the preceding paragraph it is observed that HRB Floriculture continues to remain non– compliant with the requirement of minimum public shareholding as stipulated under Rule 192b and Rule 19A of the SCRR.\n1.1 Whether any other action as contemplated under the Interim Order dated June 15 2016 is warranted against HRB Floriculture its Promoters and Promoter Group alongwith its Directors?\n1.2 As per the

investigated into various price sensitive disclosures made by M s Suzlon Energy Limited hereinafter referred to as ‘Suzlon the company’ for the period of November 3 2009 and December 2 2009.\nDuring the course of investigation it was observed that Suzlon had amended its code of internal procedures and conduct for prevention of insider trading for listed companies “Code of Conduct” in line with amendments in SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 hereinafter referred to as “PIT Regulations” Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30 2013 notified on November 19 2008 only on February 4th 2011 i.e  after a delay of more than 2 years.\nFurther no mechanism for preclearance of trades was incorporated in the Code of Conduct despite being mandated by the PIT Regulations.\nIt was alleged that the Code of Conduct was to be implemented under the overall supervision of the Board of Directors of Suzlon hereinafter referred to as “the Board”.\nShri Pradip Kumar Khaitan hereinafter referred to as “the Noticee” was a NonExecutive Independent Director of the Company during the relevant period.\nAs a member of the Board the Noticee was also allegedly responsible for the delay in amendment and implementation of the Code of Conduct.\nAs a result of this delay the Board including the Noticee was alleged to have violated Clause 1.2 of Model code of Conduct in Part A Schedule I provided under Regulation 121 of the PIT Regulations and was therefore liable for monetary penalty under section 15HB of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992 hereinafter referred to as “SEBI Act”.\nThe undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer vide order of SEBI dated April 17 2012 under section 15I of the

11.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30 2013 CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 13.\nI have carefully perused the charges against the Noticee mentioned in the SCN the submissions of the Noticee and the documents available on record.\nThe issue that arises for consideration in the present case is stated and determined as follows  Whether the Noticee has violated Clause 1.2 of Model code of Conduct in Part A Schedule I provided under Regulation 121 of the PIT Regulations?\nBefore proceeding to decide the above issue it is important to have a look at the abovementioned provisions as they existed at the relevant time which interalia are reproduced below.\nPIT Regulations “Code of internal procedures and conduct for listed companies and other entities.\n1 All listed companies and organisations associated with securities markets including  a the intermediaries as mentioned in section 12 of the Act asset management company and trustees of mutual funds ; b the selfregulatory organisations recognised or authorised by the Board; c the recognised stock exchanges and clearing house or corporations; d the public financial institutions as defined in section 4A of the Companies Act 1956; and e the professional firms such as auditors accountancy firms law firms analysts consultants etc. assisting or advising listed companies Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30 2013 shall frame a code of internal procedures and conduct as near thereto the Model Code specified in Schedule I of these Regulations without diluting it in any manner and ensure compliance of the same.”\nModel Code of Conduct Schedule I Part A under Reg. 121 of PIT Regulations 1.0 Compliance Officer 1.1 ... 1.2 The compliance officer shall be responsible for setting forth policies procedures monitoring adherence to the rules for the preservation of “Price Sensitive Information” preclearing; of designated employees’ and their dependents’ trades directly or through respective department heads as decided by the company monitoring of trades and the implementation of the code of conduct under the overall supervision of the Board of the listed company.”\nSuzlon as a listed company was required to comply with the PIT Regulations and accordingly had to implement code of Conduct as required by Regulation 121 of the PIT Regulations.\nAccordingly Suzlon was required to amend its code of conduct in line with the amendments in PIT Regulations.\nHowever Suzlon implemented the amended Code of Conduct only on February 4th 2011 which is more than 2 years after the notification.\nThis huge delay occurred in spite of Suzlon’s Board of Directors being aware about the changes in PIT Regulations.\nThe Board was informed about the changes in the PIT regulations in the meeting dated July 31 2009 by  Mr Sundar Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30 2013 Rajagopalan who was the President Legal and General Counsel of Suzlon.\nThe Board unduly delayed the implementation of revised Code of Conduct by deferring the matter when it was listed as agenda item in the Board meetings dated May 29 2010 and August 13 2010 and the code was subsequently passed in the board meeting dated February 4 2011.\nIt is clear from the material available on record that the Board was aware of the requirement to implement a new code of conduct and inspite of this the Board deferred the deliberation on the code of conduct for two meetings.\nThus it is clear that Suzlon delayed the implementation of new code of conduct.\nAs per Clause 1.2 of Model code of Conduct in Part A Schedule I provided under Regulation 121 of the PIT Regulations the compliance officer is responsible for implementation of Code of conduct under the overall supervision of the Board.\nIn the present matter it is clear that the Board by delaying the implementation has acted in violation of the above mentioned provision.\nI note that the Noticee was admittedly NonExecutive Independent Director of the Company during the period August 25 2004 to April 28 2011.\nThe Board of Suzlon after granting approval for drafting a new code of conduct was supposed to discuss it in the meeting held on May 29 2010.\nHowever the new code of conduct could No be discussed by the Board on May 29 2010 and it was kept in Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30 2013 abeyance.\nThe said draft was supposed to be considered again in the meeting dated August 13 2010 but even in this meeting the issue could No be discussed.\nFinally the draft was considered and approved in the meeting held on February 4 2011 which was after more than 2 years of amendment of PIT Regulations.\nI have perused the papers relating to the Board of directors of Suzlon at the time of relevant Board meetings i.e  from November 19 2008 till February 4 2011.\nI note that the Noticees name figured in the list of the Board of Directors of Suzlon in all the four relevant meetings when the issue of change in the code of conduct was to be discussed.\nHowever it is observed from the details of Board meeting attendance provided by Suzlon that the Noticee did No attend these four Board meetings.\nThus the role of director and the responsibilities attached to that position in a listed company cannot be underestimated.\nIn terms of the Rule 6 of the Adjudicating Rules copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and also to Securities and Exchange Board of India.\nDate September 30 2013 PIYOOSH GUPTA Place Mumbai ADJUDICATING OFFICER","", "

purposes of subregulations 1 and 1A the term acquirer shall include a pledgee other than a bank or a financial institution and such pledgee shall make disclosure to the target company and the stock exchange within two days of creation of pledge.\n2 The disclosures mentioned in subregulations 1 and 1A shall be made within two days of— a the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares; or b the

Initial Disclosure 13.\n1 Any person who holds more than 5% shares or voting rights in any listed company shall disclose to the company in Form A the number of shares or voting rights held by such person on becoming such holder within 2 working days of — a the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares; or b the acquisition of shares or voting rights as the case may be.\nUpon perusal of the material available on record I note that on February 20 2010 MIL made allotment of 248500000 shares of 1  each to the preferential allottees of the convertible equity warrants pursuant to the decision of its Board of Directors that convertible warrants where full amount of consideration has been received by the company be converted into equal number of shares of 1  each.\nI also note from the material on record as well Adjudication Order against Nazima Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd as from the material available in public domain that after such conversion MIL had issued capital of 320000000 shares of 1  each as on February 20 2010 and the noticee was allotted 17345000 shares of MIL pursuant to conversion of its convertible warrants into equity shares which constituted 5.42% of the issued share capital of MIL at the relevant time.\nI also note that MIL vide letter dated March 07 2013 has also informed SEBI that it has No received any disclosure from any other person or entity other than the promoter.\nI also note that even the announcements at the BSE website does No contain any disclosure made by the noticee for the aforementioned acquisition of MILs equity shares by the noticee on February 20 2010.\nMoreover I note that despite the SCN and hearing notices having been served upon the noticee in terms of provisions of Rule 43 read with Rule 7 of the Adjudication Rules it failed to submit any reply to the SCN and has No refuted the charges.\nThat being the case they were under obligation to make disclosure about their aggregate shareholding or voting rights in the MIL to MIL as well as to BSE within 2 days of transaction as stipulated by the aforementioned regulations.\nIn the instant matter I find that it is a matter of record that the noticees shareholding post conversion of warrants into equity shares was 5.42% only which is much below the limits prescribed under regulation 111 of SAST Regulations 1997.\nAs regards the violation of regulation 131 of PIT Regulations 1992 I note that under the said regulation any person who holds more than 5% shares or voting rights in any listed company is under an obligation to disclose to the company in the prescribed Form the number of shares or voting rights held by such person on becoming the holder within two working days of the receipt of allotment of shares or acquisition of shares or voting rights.\nIn the instant case it is a matter of record that the noticee was allotted 5.42% of the equity share capital of MIL on February 20 2010 for which as has been found above no disclosure as stipulated by the aforementioned regulation was made by the Noticee.\nIssue II Violation of the provisions of section 11C3 and 11C5 of SEBI Act 1992 21.\nIt would be appropriate here to refer to the aforesaid provisions of the SEBI Act 1992 which reads as under Section 11C3 and Section 11C5 of the SEBI Act 1992 Section 11C3 The Investigating Authority may require any intermediary or any person associated with securities market in any manner to furnish such information to or produce such books or registers or other documents or record before him or any person authorised by it in this behalf as it may consider necessary if the furnishing of such information or the production of such books or registers or other documents or record is relevant or necessary for the purposes of its investigation.\nSection 11C5 Any person directed to make an investigation under sub section 1 may examine on oath any manager managing director officer and other employee of any intermediary or any person associated with securities market in any manner in relation to the affairs of his business and may administer an oath accordingly and for that purpose may require any of those persons to appear before it personally.\nAdjudication Order against Nazima Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd 22.\nI find from the material available on record that the Noticee was issued summons dated February 22 2013 under section 11C3 of the SEBI Act to furnish certain information as mentioned in the Annexure to the summons before the IA on March 04 2013.\nI also note that Noticee vide letter dated March 03 2013 submitted only part of the information as required by summons dated February 22 2013 and further stated that other details sought vide the said summons would be submitted in due course of time.\nIt is also a matter of record that the Noticee was issued summon dated March 08 2013 under section 11C5 of the SEBI Act to appear in person before the IA on March 20 2013 to answer questions in relation to the investigation which the noticee failed to do.\nAdjudication Order against Nazima Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd 24.\nIssue III  Does the violation if any attract monetary penalty under section 15Aa and 15A b of SEBI Act 1992?\nSection 11C of the Act was introduced with effect from 29.10.2002 and subsection 3 thereof provides that the investigating authority may require any person associated with the securities market “to furnish such information or produce such books or registers or other documents or record before him...”.\nThe power to require a person to furnish any information or record or documents includes the power to require such person to make a statement and give clarifications with regard to the information and documents produced by him.\nThus it is clear that if a person fails to comply with the summonses of IA he is liable for penalty under Sec.\n15A a of SEBI Act.\nAs the violation of provisions of section 11C3 and 11C5 of SEBI Act 1992 by the noticee has been established I hold that Noticees are liable for monetary penalty under section 15A a of SEBI Act.\nAs the violation of the statutory obligation Adjudication Order against Nazima Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd under regulation 71 read with regulation 72 of SAST Regulations 1997 and regulation 131 of PIT Regulations 1992 has been established I hold that the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under section 15Ab of SEBI Act.\nThe aforesaid provisions read as under 15A.\nPenalty for failure to furnish information return etc. If any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder a to furnish any document return or report to the Board fails to furnish the same he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less; b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less;\nIssue IV  What would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of SEBI Act?\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under section 15Aa and 15Ab it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under “15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.”\nI note that the material made available on record has No quantified the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticee and the loss suffered by the investors as a result of the Noticees default.\nAlso there is no material made available on record to assess the amount of loss caused to investors or the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by Adjudication Order against Nazima Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd the Noticee as a result of default.\nAfter taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case I in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15I 2 of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules hereby impose following penalty hereby impose following penalty on the noticee i.e  Nazima Impex Pvt Ltd  Penalty Amount Violation 250000  Rupees Two Lakh Fifty Thousand Only Under section 15Ab of SEBI Act for

Therefore the adjudication proceedings against the Noticee are undertaken exparte on the basis of material available on records.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 11.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the instant matter are 11.1 Whether the Noticee had failed to make required disclosures under the PIT Regulations and SAST Regulations as alleged in the SCN?\n2 If yes whether the failure on the part of the Noticee would attract monetary penalty under Section 15A b of the SEBI Act?\n3 If yes what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed upon the Noticee taking into consideration the factors stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 2 of the Adjudication Rules?\nIssue 11.1 Whether the Noticee had failed to make mandated disclosures under the PIT Regulations and SAST Regulations as alleged in the SCN?\nThe details regarding change of more than 2% in the shareholding of the Noticee in the Company as alleged in the SCN is No in dispute in absence of any reply from the Noticee.\nThe details of change in shareholding of the Noticee in the scrip of the Company is as follows Date Shareholding No of shares % of share capital April 01 2013 39439981 7.85 May 28 2013 27857966 5.54 Change in Shareholding 2.31 May 28 2013 27857966 5.54 September 04 2013 17475703 3.47 Change in shareholding 2.07 13.\nRegulation 133 of the PIT Regulations requires any person who holds more than 5% shares or voting rights in any listed company to disclose to the company the number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights if there has been change in such holdings from the last disclosure made under Regulation 131 Adjudication Order in the matter of Vakrangee Limited or under this subregulation; and such change exceeds 2% of the total shareholding or voting rights in a company within two working days.\nSimilarly Regulation 292 of the SAST Regulations requires any acquirer holding shares or voting rights entitling him for five percent or more of shares or voting rights in a target company to disclose the number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights if there has been change in such holdings from the last disclosure and such change exceeds two percent of the total shareholding or voting rights in a target company even if such change results in shareholding falling below five percent.\nOn perusal of the available records table reproduced in paragraph 12 hereinabove it is observed that the shareholding of the Noticee got reduced on May 28 2013 by 2.31% and by 2.07% on September 04 2013.\nThus upon change of more than 2% in its shareholding in the Company the Noticee ought to have disclosed in terms of Regulation 133 read with 135 of the PIT Regulations and Regulation 292 read with 293 of the SAST Regulations.\nI note from the Annexure 4 of the SCN that the BSE had confirmed vide its email dated September 06 2016 that it has No received any disclosures from the Noticee under PIT Regulations or SAST Regulations in the scrip of the Company.\nAdditionally I have verified from the website of the BSE and observed that no disclosure was available there regarding the said decrease in shareholding.\nSimilarly I also note from Annexure 6 of the SCN that the NSE vide its email dated September 07 2016 had confirmed that it had No received any disclosures from the Noticee in the scrip of the Company under PIT Regulations or SAST Regulations.\nI further note from Annexure 7 of the SCN that the Company had provided disclosures received by it during the Investigation Period to SEBI vide email dated August 22 2016.\nOn perusal of the disclosures forwarded by the Company I observe that the same did No contain any mention of the Noticee having communicated any disclosures to the Company.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of Vakrangee Limited 18.\nIssue 11.2 If yes whether the failure on the part of the Noticee would attract monetary penalty under Section 15A b of the SEBI Act?\nI have taken into account the wellknown judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the matter of The Chairman SEBI v.\nIn view of the aforesaid I am convinced that the failure of Noticee in making disclosures to the Company under Regulation 133 read with 135 of the PIT Regulations and failure to make disclosures to the target company as well as Stock Exchanges under Regulation 292 read with 293 of the SAST Regulations attracts imposition of monetary penalty on the Noticee under Section 15A b of the SEBI Act text of which is reproduced as under “15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefore in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefore in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.”\nIssue 11.3 If yes what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed upon the Noticee taking into consideration the factors stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 2 of the Adjudication Rules?\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act I have considered the factors stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act which reads as under “15J.\nFactors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer Adjudication Order in the matter of Vakrangee Limited While adjudging quantum of penalty under Section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made

I note that on August 21 2013  Mr Ritesh Bodiwala placed a sell order for 5 shares at an order price Rs 302.70 at 93001 and Noticee No 3 placed a buy order for 1 share at 093040 at Rs 302.70.\nSubsequently during the day Noticee No 1 placed a buy order of 1 lakh shares on two occasions and 124503 shares respectively the trade got executed with Noticee No 4 for 1 share with other seller  Mr Kausha Himanshi Mehta for 2 shares and with  Mr E.Shanmugam for 324500 shares.\nThe trading pattern of Notice 23 and 4 is completely orchestrated where all three had acted in tandem for the benefit of Noticee 1 and this fact is corroborated with the following i.\nOn all the trading days i.e August 08 2013 to August 21 2013 other three Noticees were largely active in the scrip on each day as and when scrip had traded.\nI also note that Noticee 2 & 3 have No traded in any other scrip during this period and in this pattern they were completely focused on the scrip of TCP. iii.\nAll the buy orders and sale orders were entered at the same price and same quantity when trades were executed between Noticees No 2 3 and 4 .\nI note in the current scenario also Noticee No 1 has benefited to the extent over Rs 13 crores by able to buy shares of TCP at the reduced price owing to the trading of Noticees No 2 3 and 4.\nI have studied the trading pattern of Noticees and observed that Noticees No 2 & 3 have No dealt in any scrip the way they had dealt in TCP.\nHence I had studied the trading pattern of Noticee No 4 and observed that he was actively dealing in securities market during In the matter of M s TCP Ltd IP.\nHe seems to be a day trader where he appears to be doing jobbing taking a position in the morning and by end of the day reversing that position.\nDuring April 01 2013 March 31 2014 I have observed that similar to his pattern of putting order of 11 share in the scrip of TCP similar trading was done on other scrips as well as.\nIn his trading in other scrips Noticee No 4 had squared off his entire position and only 3 trades lead to delivery.\nThe time gap between orders noticee 2 3 and 4 was very less largely in the range of 20 seconds to 2 minutes which quite unlikely in case of scrip No trading from last four months.\nThe buy and sale order quantity and price was always the same for all the trades of noticee 2 3 and 4.\nNoticees No 2 & 3 had denied any relationship of them with Noticee 1 except that Noticee 2 is the executive director the company of which Noticee 1 is the Promoter.\nIt is interesting to note here that Noticee No 2 in his statement before SEBI IVD had stated that he was aware of the fact that there is going to be interse transfer of shares between promoters Noticee No and  Mr E Shanmugam.\nTherefore I conclude that the trades done by the Noticees No 1 2 3 and 4 are in violation of Section 12Aa b c of SEBI Act 1992 read with Regulations 3ab c d read with Regulations 41 42 a e of PFUTP Regulations thus liable for monetary penalty.\nIssue I b Whether Noticees No 1 and 2 have violated Schedule I Part A of the PIT Regulations 1992 to be read with Regulation 12 of PIT Regulations 2015?\nRelevant provisions of PIT Regulation SCHEDULE I [Under regulation 121] Code of internal procedures and conduct for listed companies and other entities.\n1 all listed companies and organizations associated with securities markets PART A MODEL CODE OF CONDUCT FOR PREVENTION OFINSIDER TRADING FOR LISTED COMPANIES 4.2 All directors officers designated employees who buy or sell any number of shares of the company shall No enter into an opposite transaction i.e  sell or buy any number of shares during the next six months following the prior transaction.\nAll directors officers In the matter of M s TCP Ltd designated employees shall also No take positions in derivative transactions in the shares of the company at any time.\nIn the case of subscription in the primary market initial public offers the above mentioned entities shall hold their investments for a minimum period of 30 days.\nRelevant Provisions of PIT Regulations 2015 12.\n1 The Securities and Exchange Board of India Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 are hereby repealed.\n2 Notwithstanding such repeal— a the previous operation of the repealed regulations or anything duly done or suffered thereunder any right privilege obligation or liability acquired accrued or incurred under the repealed regulations any penalty forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against the repealed regulations or any investigation legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right privilege obligation liability penalty forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid shall remain unaffected as if the repealed regulations had never been repealed;

b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nIt is clear that the activities undertaken by these Noticees were done to provide direct benefit to Noticee 1 in acquiring shares from another promoter at the reduced price.\nI note that Noticee No.1 had acquired 10 24503 shares during August 16 2013 August 21 2013 at the average price of Rs 323.451 which means the benefit to Noticee 1 was  Number of shares purchased *Last traded price – Number of shares purchased *Average purchase price 10 24503*454.65 10 24503*323.45 = Rs 13 44 14793.\nSEBI has been entrusted with the important mandate of protecting the investors and safeguarding the integrity of the securities market.\nIn view of the above after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case the material available on record the submission made by the Noticees in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of Rules I hereby impose a monetary penalty as under  Sl.\nNo Name of the Noticee Penal Provision under SEBI Act 1992 Amount of Penalty Rs  1  Mr V R Venkatchalam Section 15 HA of SEBI Act 1992 Rs 150000000  Rupees Fifteen Crores only Section 15HB of SEBI Act 1992 Rs 300000  Rupees Three Lakhs only 2  Mr V Rajasekharan Section 15 HA of SEBI Act 1992 Rs 10000000  Rupees One Crore only Section 15HB of SEBI Act 1992 Rs 300000  Rupees Three Lakhs only 3 Ms. Rajasekharan Devaki Section 15 HA of SEBI Act 1992 Rs 10000000Rupees One Crore only 4 MMr Srivatsan P  Rs 10000000  Rupees One Crore only In the matter of M s TCP Ltd 34.\nThe Noticees shall remit pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order either by way of Demand Draft in favor of “SEBI  Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai OR through epayment facility into Bank Account the details of which are given below Account No for remittance of penalties levied by Adjudication Officer Bank Name State Bank of India Branch BandraKurla Complex RTGS Code SBIN0004380 Beneficiary Name SEBI – Penalties Remittable To Government of India Beneficiary A c No 31465271959 35.\nThe Noticees shall forward said Demand Draft or the details confirmation of penalty so paid through epayment to the Deputy General Manager Enforcement Department  DRA II of SEBI.\nThe format for forwarding details confirmations of epayments shall be made in the following tabulated form as provided in SEBI Circular No SEBI HO GSD T&A CIR P 2017 42 dated May 16 2017 and details of such payment shall be intimated at email ID tad@sebi.gov.in Date Department of SEBI Name of Intermediary other Entity Type of Intermediary SEBI Registration Number if any PAN Amount in Rs  Purpose of payment including the period for which payment was made e.g Quarterly annually Bank Name and Account Number from which payment is remitted UTR No 36.\nIn terms of Rule 6 of the Rules copies of this order are sent to the Noticees and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.\nDate January 31 2018 SAHIL MALIK Place Mumbai ADJUDICATING OFFICER mailtotad@sebi.gov.in","Therefore I conclude that the trades done by the Noticees No 1 2 3 and 4 are in violation of Section 12Aa b c of SEBI Act 1992 read with Regulations 3ab c d read with Regulations 41 42 a e of PFUTP Regulations thus liable for monetary penalty.I note the provisions of Section 15HA and Section 15HB of SEBI Act as existed during the period of violation as applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case read as under Penalty for fraudulent and unfair trade practices 15HA.If any person indulges in fraudulent and unfair trade practices relating to securities he shall be liable to a penalty of twenty five crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of such practices whichever is higher.Since the violations against the Noticees has been established therefore I am of the view that monetary penalty should be levied under Section 15 HA of the SEBI Act on Noticees No 1 2 3 and 4 and under Section 15HB of SEBI Act on Noticees No 1 and 2.In view of the above after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case the material available on record the submission made by the Noticees in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of Rules I hereby impose a monetary penalty as under  Sl.No Name of the Noticee Penal Provision under SEBI Act 1992 Amount of Penalty Rs  1  Mr V R Venkatchalam Section 15 HA of SEBI Act 1992 Rs 150000000  Rupees Fifteen Crores only Section 15HB of SEBI Act 1992 Rs 300000  Rupees Three Lakhs only 2  Mr V Rajasekharan Section 15 HA of SEBI Act 1992 Rs 10000000  Rupees One Crore only Section 15HB of SEBI Act 1992 Rs 300000  Rupees Three Lakhs only 3 Ms. Rajasekharan Devaki Section 15 HA of SEBI Act 1992 Rs 10000000Rupees One Crore only 4 MMr Srivatsan P  Rs 10000000  Rupees One Crore only In the matter of M s TCP Ltd 34.", " 15G"))

of the Authorized Representative was acceded to and the Noticee was given additional time until December 18 2018 to make submissions.\nThereafter vide letter dated December 18 2018 the Noticee made following additional submissions a.\nSince the inquiry proceedings in the instant matter are concluded I proceed to decide the case on merit taking into account the allegations levelled against the Noticee in the SCN submissions of the Noticee towards the SCN and material available on record.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 12.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the instant matter are Issue No I Whether the Noticee failed to make disclosures required under Regulation 134A of the PIT Regulations as alleged in the SCN?\nIssue No II If yes whether the failure on the part of the Noticee would attract monetary penalty under Section 15A b of the SEBI Act?\nIssue No III If yes what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed upon the Noticee taking into consideration the factors stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 2 of the Adjudication Rules?\nIssue No I Whether the Noticee failed to make disclosures required under Regulation 134A of the PIT Regulations as alleged in the SCN?\nRegulation 134A of the PIT Regulations requires any person who is a promoter or part of a promoter group of a listed company to disclose to the company as well as the Adjudication Order in the matter of Man Industries India Limited stock exchanges the number of shares held and change in such shareholding if there is a change in shareholding from the last disclosure made and such change exceeds Rs 5 Lakhs in value or 25000 shares or 1% of the total shareholding.\nFrom the reply of the Noticee I note that the facts relating to the Noticee being a promoter of the Company during the Examination Period and reduction of shareholding of the Noticee in the Company are No disputed.\nHowever the Noticee has submitted that the reduction of 165000 shares was effected in the form of transfer of possession by way of pledge and the ownership of the said shares continued to be with the Noticee.\nThe Noticee also submitted that she had made a disclosure under Regulation 292 of the SAST Regulations to the BSE for the reduction in her shareholding of 165000 shares.\nI note that although the Noticee has contended that the transaction was a pledge transaction and No a sale transaction Noticee has No brought any material on record to substantiate her claim of a pledge such as documents pertaining to pledge creation or reason for making a pledge.\nThus creation of pledge over shares does No involve transfer of beneficial ownership of those shares.\nHowever a perusal of Statement of Transactions carried out by the Noticee reveals that shares were debited from the beneficial account of the Noticee and credited to the beneficial account number 10127746 vide order number 10000021368344 indicating that the transaction on August 16 2013 involved a change in beneficial ownership.\nTo verify the claim of the Noticee that information relating to the aforesaid change in shareholding was in public domain by way of disclosure under Regulation 292 of the SAST Regulations I have perused the copy of disclosure submitted by the Noticee.\nOn perusal I note that the disclosure under Regulation 292 of the SAST Regulations was made by Persons Acting in Concert PAC i.e  Mrs. Anita J. Mansukhani  Mr J C Mansukhani Ms. Priyal J. Mansukhani M s.\nJPA Solutions Pvt Ltd. Jagdish Mansukhani HUF and M s Man Steel and Power Limited and mentions a pledge transaction of 165000 shares on August 20 2013.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of Man Industries India Limited 17.\nI also note that in the disclosure it is mentioned that the mode of sale is “by way of encumbrance transfer against loans dues to the lending entity”.\nIt is also noted that under SAST Regulations a disclosure for creation invocation release of is required in a different format under Regulation 31 of the SAST Regulations.\nI note that other than the statement in the aforesaid disclosure which mentions “encumbrance transfer against loans dues to the lending entity” there is no evidence of any loan taken or collateral given.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of Man Industries India Limited 21.\nIt is pertinent to note that Regulation 134A of the PIT Regulations gets triggered when shareholding of a person who is a promoter or belongs to promoter group undergoes change and such change exceeds Rs 5 lakh in value or 25000 shares or 1% of the total shareholding in the Company.\nIssue No II If yes whether the failure on the part of the Noticee would attract monetary penalty under Section 15A b of the SEBI Act?\n& Issue No III If yes what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed upon the Noticee taking into consideration the factors stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 2 of the Adjudication Rules?\nAdjudication Order in the matter of Man Industries India Limited 24.\nSince failure of the Noticee in making disclosures to the Company as well as BSE & NSE under Regulation 134A read with 135 of the PIT Regulations is established I am of the view that it warrants imposition of monetary penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act on the Noticee text of which is reproduced as under SEBI Act “15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder— .... b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefore in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefore in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.”\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act the following factors stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act have to be given due regard a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nI also note that the Noticee has cited numerous judicial precedents with regard to levy of penalty and intention of the Noticee.\nThese submissions are noted and taken on record.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of Man Industries India Limited 27.\nI also note that no quantifiable figures are available on record to assess disproportionate gain made or loss caused to investors by the aforesaid violation.\nAfter taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case in exercise of powers conferred upon me under Section 15I 2 of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules I hereby impose a penalty of 200000  Rupees Two Lakh only upon the Noticee i.e  Ms. Anita Mansukhani under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act for violation of Regulation 134A read with 135 of the PIT Regulations.\nThe Noticee shall remit pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order either by way of Demand Draft in favour of “SEBI  Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai OR through epayment facility into Bank Account the details of which are given below Account No for remittance of penalties levied by Adjudication Officer Bank Name State Bank of India Branch BandraKurla Complex RTGS Code SBIN0004380 Beneficiary Name SEBI – Penalties Remittable To Government of India Beneficiary A c No 31465271959 Adjudication Order in the matter of Man Industries India Limited 31.\nThe Noticee shall forward said Demand Draft or the details confirmation of penalty so paid to the Enforcement Department – Division of Regulatory Action – I of SEBI.\nThe Noticee shall provide the following details while forwarding DD payment information a Name and PAN of the entity Noticee b Name of the case matter c Purpose of Payment – Payment of penalty under AO proceedings d Bank Name and Account Number e Transaction Number 32.\nCopies of this Adjudication Order are being sent to the Noticee and also to SEBI in terms of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules.\nDate  January 28 2019 Maninder Cheema Place  Mumbai Adjudicating Officer","Since failure of the Noticee in making disclosures to the Company as well as BSE & NSE under Regulation 134A read with 135 of the PIT Regulations is established I am of the view that it warrants imposition of monetary penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act on the Noticee text of which is reproduced as under SEBI Act “15A.After taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case in exercise of powers conferred upon me under Section 15I 2 of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules I hereby impose a penalty of 200000  Rupees Two Lakh only upon the Noticee i.e  Ms. Anita Mansukhani under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act for violation of Regulation 134A read with 135 of the PIT Regulations.", " 15G"))

require it to make the necessary disclosures under the relevant provisions of law.\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under section 15Abof the SEBI Act1992 it is important to consider the

hereinafter referred to as SEBI had examined the alleged irregularity in the scrip of Bajaj Finance Limited herein after referred to as BFL a company listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd BSE the National Stock Exchange NSE and Multi Commodity Exchange of India Limited MCX and into possible violation of the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992 hereinafter referred to as SEBI Act and various rules and regulations made there under.\nUpon examination it was inter alia observed that one Shri Amit Raghuvanshi herein after referred to as the Noticee who was one of the designated employees of BFL had sold 1000 shares of BFL on December 31 2013 for a value of 1563263  which were acquired by him on December 28 2013 by way of exercising stock options of the

timeline as prescribed under Regulation 134 read with Regulation 135 of the SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 herein after referred to as the PIT Regulations.\nHowever it was observed that the Noticee had allegedly made the disclosures with a delay.\nAppointment of Adjudicating Officer 3.\nSEBI has therefore initiated Adjudication proceedings against the Noticee and I have been appointed as the Adjudicating Officer AO vide order dated June 16 2014 under Section 15 I of the Act read with Rule 3 of the SEBI Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer Rules 1995 hereinafter referred to as “Adjudication Rules” to inquire into and adjudge under Section 15Ab of the Act the alleged violation of the provisions of law by the

show cause as to why an inquiry should No be held and penalty should No be imposed on the Noticee under Section 15Ab of the Act for the alleged violation of the provisions of law.\nThe Noticee submitted his reply vide letter dated July 31 2014 5.\nThereafter in the interest of natural justice and in order to conduct an inquiry as per Rule 43 of the said Rules an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on September 16 2014.\nThe Noticee attended the personal hearing on the scheduled date and reiterated the written submissions made in his reply.\nConsideration of Issues Evidence and Findings 6.\nI have carefully perused the charges levelled against the Noticee in the SCN written oral submissions and all the documents available on record.\nIn the instant matter the following issues arise for consideration and determination a Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 13 4 read with Regulation 13 5 of the PIT Regulations? b Do the violations if any on the part of the Noticee attract any monetary penalty under Section 15 Ab of the Act? c If so what should be the quantum of monetary penalty?\nBefore moving forward I would like to refer to the relevant provisions of the PIT Regulations which read as under 13.\nDisclosure of interest or holding by directors and officers and substantial shareholders in a listed companies  Initial Disclosure .... 4 Any person who is a director or officer of a listed company shall disclose to the company and the stock exchange where the securities are listed in Form D the total number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights if there has been a change in such holdings of such person and his dependents as defined by the company from the last disclosure made under subregulation 2 or under this subregulation and the change exceeds Rs 5 lakh in value or 25000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower.\n5 The disclosure mentioned in subregulations 3 4 and 4A shall be made within two working days of a the receipts of intimation of allotment of shares or b the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights as the case may be.”\nI find from the SCN that BFL is listed on the BSE the NSE and MCX.\nI further find that the Noticee being a designated employee of the company had acquired 1000 shares of BFL on December 28 2013 and sold 1000 shares worth 1563263  on December 31 2013.\nAs the value of the said transaction was more than 500000 the Noticee being an officer of the company was under an obligation to disclose the change in shareholding that exceeded the value of 500000  to the company and the stock exchanges within the prescribed timeline as required under Regulation 13 4 read with 13 5 of the PIT Regulations.\nSince the Noticee made the said necessary disclosures belatedly it was alleged that he had violated the said provisions of PIT Regulations.\nThe Noticee vide his reply dated July 31 2014 submitted that he is working as the Business Head Sales Finance of BFL since October 01 2008.\nThe company had categorized him as designated employee pursuant to its Code of Conduct for Prevention of Insider Trading as approved by the Board of Directors of BFL.\nI note from the submissions made by the Noticee and the documents available on record that the Noticee had acquired 1000 shares of BFL on December 28 2013 from the exercise of stock options of BFL which he sold on December 31 2013 for a value of 1563263  As the said sale of shares exceeded 500000  in value the Noticee being the designated employee of BFL was required to make disclosures to the company and the stock exchanges within the specified two days as required under Regulation 13 4 read with 135 of the PIT Regulations.\nUpon perusal of companys letters dated December 31 2013 to BSE and NSE I find that the Noticee had made the requisite disclosures to the company on December 31 2013 itself while admittedly the disclosures to the stock exchanges were made by him belatedly to NSE on January 03 2014 at 2.41 a.m. and to BSE on January 03 2014 at 2.44 a.m. 11.\nTherefore in view of the above I conclude that the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 13 4 read with 13 5 of the PIT Regulations and thus is liable for monetary penalty under Section 15 A b of the SEBI Act which reads as under 15A.\nPenalty for failure to furnish information return etc.  If any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder ......... b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less;\nWhile imposing monetary penalty it is important to consider the factors stipulated in Section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under “15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.”\nIn view of the above after considering all the facts and circumstances of the

against the noticee are that when the company was making misleading announcements and nongenuine results it including PACs being the family members and group companies of the Chairman and the MD sold together 1015443 shares through Religare and SP Jain Securities which accounted for 12.80% of the traded volume both BSE and NSE during Adjudication Order in respect of V Jyotiprasad HUF in the matter of M s Nova Petrochemicals Ltd July 1 2010 January 23 2006 to March31 2006 before the outcome of the negative results and thereby alleged to have violated Regulation 3 a & d Regulation 41 42a of FUTP Regulations read with Section 12Ac of SEBI Act 1992 and regulation 3i of PIT Regulations read with Section 12Ad & e of SEBI Act 1992.\nI note that the provisions of law alleged to have been violated by the noticee read as follows FUTP REGULATIONS 2003 Regulation 3.\nProhibition of Certain Dealings in Securities No person shall directly or indirectly a buy sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; d engage in any act practice course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are

dealing communicating or counselling on matters relating to insider trading No insider shall— i either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person deal in securities of a company listed on any stock exchange when in possession of any unpublished price sensitive information;\nAdjudication Order in respect of V Jyotiprasad HUF in the matter of M s Nova Petrochemicals Ltd July 1 2010 SEBI ACT 1992 Regulation 12 Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control.\nNo person shall directly or indirectly – c engage in any act practice course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with the issue dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made d engage in insider trading e deal in securities while in possession of material or nonpublic information or communicate such material or nonpublic information to any other person in a manner which is in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;\nI have taken into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case the submissions made by the noticee and the material available on the record.\nOn perusal of the documents available on record as well as the submissions made by the Noticee I find that the NPL made major corporate announcements on 6 days during the period January 23 2006 to March 08 2006.\nThese announcements were related to quarterly financial results Bonus issue and expansion plan.\nI note from the SCN that except for announcement on an expansion plan all other announcements were implemented by NPL.\nI also note that the price of the scrip after the above announcement went up from Rs 102.50 on February 20 2006 to Rs 146.85 on March 8 2006.\nIt is noted from the SCN that the NPL incurred a loss of Rs 5.23 crore as on 31st March 2006 whereas the sum total of the unaudited figures for the quarter ending June to March 2006 showed a profit of Rs 1.38 crore.\nFrom the trade and order log it is observed that the 25 PACs including the Noticee offloaded 1015433 shares which was 12.80% of the traded volume on the exchanges NSE and BSE and 7.52% of total capital in the market after the positive announcements that too after the expansion plan were made by the company.\nThe PACs who sold the shares were the family members and group companies of the Chairman  Mr Vedprakash Chiripal and Managing Director  Mr Shyam Gupta.\nI note from the SCN as well as from the noticee’s submission that it had sold 12000 shares on March 06 2006 against its holding of 12200 shares as on March 31 2005.\nI note that the PACs held 35.31% of the total capital of NPL as on March 31 2005 and the noticee held 0.26% of the PACs’ holding.\nI also note that the noticee’s sale of 12000 shares constitutes 1.2% of the total shares sold by the PACs during the investigation period.\nI note from the material available on record that there is no allegation about the noticee’s involvement in any of these misleading announcements or resultant price rise in the scrip of NPL.\nIn fact I note from the investigation report that the noticee has dealt in the scrip after NPL made misleading announcements which influenced the price and the volume.\nI note that Regulations 3a and 3d of FUTP prohibits a person to deal in securities in a fraudulent manner and engage in any act practice course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person respectively with regard to ‘issue’ ‘purchase’ or ‘sale’ of any security listed or proposed to be listed at a recognized stock exchange.\nFurther Regulation 41 and 42 prohibit persons from indulging in fraudulent or unfair trade practices while dealing in securities.\nWhat is being alleged against the noticee is that he played a fraud and committed an unfair practice within the meaning of the regulations while trading in the scrip of NPL.\nBefore dealing with the issue as to whether the noticee violated the provisions of regulation 3i of PIT Regulations I note the definition of insider and price sensitive information under PIT Regulations as follows Regulation 2e “insider” means any person who is or was connected with the company or is deemed to have been connected with the company and is reasonably expected to have access to unpublished price sensitive information in respect of securities of company or has received or has had access to such unpublished price sensitive information.\nRegulation 2c “connected person” means any person who i “is a director as defined in clause 13 of section 2 of the Companies Act 1956 1 of 1956 of a company or is deemed to be a director of that company by virtue of subclause 10 of section 307 of that Act” Regulation 2h “person is deemed to be a connected person” if such person— i is a company under the same management or group or any subsidiary company thereof within the meaning of sub section 1B of section 370 or subsection 11 of section 372 of the Companies Act 1956 1 of 1956 or subclause g of section 2 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1969 54 of 1969 as the case may be; viii relatives of the connected person Regulation 2ha “price sensitive information” means any information which relates directly or in directly to a company and which if published is likely to materially affect the price of securities of company.\nExplanation.—The following shall be deemed to be price sensitive information— i periodical financial results of the company; ii intended declaration of dividends both interim and final; iii issue of securities or buyback of securities; iv any major expansion plans or execution of new projects. v amalgamation mergers or takeovers;\nAdjudication Order in respect of V Jyotiprasad HUF in the matter of M s Nova Petrochemicals Ltd July 1 2010 vi disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking; vii and significant changes in policies plans or operations of the company;\nI note from the noticee’s submission that because it is related to  Mr Ved Prakash Chiripal the Chairman of NPL it falls within the ambit of PAC.\nI note that the information related to financial results and expansion plan falls within the definition of price sensitive information as defined in the Regulation 2 of PIT Regulations.\nThis includes among others financial results of the company intended declaration of dividend – both interim and final amalgamations mergers and takeovers.”\nThis is also evident form the fact that when the price of the scrip after the above misleading announcements went up from Rs 102.50 on February 20 2006 to Rs 146.85 on March 8 2006 the noticee who is related to Mr Ved Prakash Chiripal the Chairman of NPL sold 12000 shares on March 06 2006 and continues to hold only 200 shares.\nIn view of the foregoing I hold that the allegation of violation of provisions of regulations 3i of PIT Regulations and Section 12 Ad & e of SEBI Act 1992 against the noticee stands established.\nAdjudication Order in respect of V Jyotiprasad HUF in the matter of M s Nova Petrochemicals Ltd July 1 2010 LEVY OF PENALTY 27.\nThus the violation of sections 12A d&e of SEBI Act and regulation 3 i of PIT Regulations by the Noticee makes him liable for penalty under section 15G i of the SEBI Act1992.which read as follows 15G.Penalty for insider trading  If any insider who i either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person deals in securities of a body corporate listed on any stock exchange on the basis of any unpublished price sensitive information 29.\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under section 15 G i it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under “15J Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nIn the absence of material available on record the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made as a result of the default and the amount of loss caused to the investors due to the said default cannot be quantified.\nI note that the noticee being an insider traded in the scrip when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information which is prohibited under the SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 and also under SEBI Act 1992.\nAdjudication Order in respect of V Jyotiprasad HUF in the matter of M s Nova Petrochemicals Ltd July 1 2010 ORDER

b Does the violation if any on the part of the Noticee attract monetary penalty under section 15A b of SEBI Act? c If so what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of SEBI Act?\nBefore moving forward it is pertinent to refer to the provisions of regulation 13 of PIT Regulations which reads as under Initial Disclosure 1 Any person who holds more than 5% shares or voting rights in any listed company shall disclose to the company [in Form A] the number of shares or voting rights held by such person on becoming such holder within 4 working days of — a the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares; or b the acquisition of shares or voting rights as the case may be.\n2 ........... Continual disclosure 3 Any person who holds more than 5% shares or voting rights in any listed company shall disclose to the company [in Form C] the number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights even if such change results in shareholding falling below 5% if there has been change in such holdings from the last disclosure made under subregulation 1 or under this subregulation; and such change exceeds 2% of total shareholding or voting rights in the company.\n5 The disclosure mentioned in subregulations 3 and 4 shall be made within 4 working days of  a the receipts of intimation of allotment of shares or b the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights as the case may be.\nDisclosure by company to stock exchanges 6 Every listed company within five days of receipt shall disclose to all stock exchanges on which the company is listed the information received under subregulations 1 2 3 and 4 in the respective formats specified in Schedule III. 11.\nAs per regulation 131 of PIT Regulations any person whose shareholding is in excess of 5% in any listed company has to make the required disclosure to the company in a prescribed format within 4 working days from a the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares or b the acquisition of shares or voting rights.\nAs per regulations 13 3 & 5 of PIT Regulations any person who is holding more than 5% of shares or voting rights in any listed company has to make the required disclosure to the company if there is any change in shareholding of such person by more than 2% of total shareholding or voting rights in the company in a prescribed format within 4 working days from a the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares or b the acquisition of shares or voting rights as the case may be.\nAs per regulation 136 of PIT Regulations on receipt of any information by the listed company under regulation 13 1 2 3 & 4 of PIT Regulations such company has to disclose such information in the prescribed format to all stock exchanges on which the company is listed within five days of receipt of such information by the company.\nThe charge against the Noticee is that it had delayed in making the required disclosure in the prescribed format to BSE thus had violated the provisions of regulation 136 of PIT Regulations.\nI find from the submissions of the Noticee that it has No disputed the fact that Pashupati Fincap Limited had acquired 280000 shares of PSWML from Shailaja Investments Limited through off market transactions.\nFurther I find that Noticee had also No disputed the fact that the promoter group entities i.e  Pashupati Fincap Ltd and Shailja Investments Ltd had made the required disclosure in respect of their change in shareholding due to abovementioned off market transaction to the Noticee in a prescribed format on September 11 2009 as per regulation 131 and regulation 133 of PIT Regulations.\nThe Noticee vide it reply dated June 22 2010 and July 26 2010 contended that it had made the disclosure in the prescribed format within the time limit specified under regulation 136 of PIT Regulations.\nFurther Noticee emphasizes on the point that it had dispatched the said disclosure in a prescribed format to the BSE under Certificate of Posting “UPC” on September 12 2009 i.e  one day after receipt of information from the acquirer and seller.\nNoticee had submitted the proof of dispatch i.e  a copy of the cover bearing the seal of New Delhi Connaught Place Post Office.\nThe Noticee vide its reply dated June 22 2010 had relied on the judgment pronounced by the Bihar High Court in Dineshwar Prasad Singh Vs.\nI have noted the submission of the Noticee that Pasupati Fincap Limited and Shailaja Investments Limtied are both promoter group entities and the total shareholding of the promoter group remained unchanged for the quarter ending September 2009.\nThus no material change adversely affecting the investing public has occurred on account of the alleged No delivery of the letter dated September 12 2009 to BSE.\nI have also noted the submission of the Noticee that company is declared a sick company under Sick Industrial Companies Act vide order dated July 21 2005 by Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction and the company is making earnest efforts to recover from the financially weak position.\nDuring the course of hearing on inquiring the Noticee about whether it had proof of delivery in reply to it Noticee asserted that it had proof of dispatch only and the disclosure was dispatched to BSE under Certificate of Posting on September 12 2009.\nFurther Noticee had requested the undersigned to take a lenient view in the matter.\nIn view of the above from the documents available on record I find that Noticee had made the disclosure on December 18 2009 i.e  only after the intimation by SEBI to the Noticee that it had No made the required disclosure as per regulation 136 of PIT Regulations within the stipulated time in relation to the off market transaction which took place between the promoter group entities.\nIn relation to this Noticee had replied that the disclosure made on December 18 2009 was a copy of the disclosure dispatched to BSE on September 12 2009.\nThus the Noticee had implicitly admitting the fact that the disclosure was made on December 18 2009 i.e  with a delay of 93 days to BSE.\nThe information or disclosure must however reach the company.\nIn law anyone sending a written information through the agency of someone else appoints such agency as his agent.\nIf a letter is posted unless the law specifies the Postal Authority acts as an agent of the sender.\nIn the light of the above I have also perused the copy of the cover bearing the seal of New Delhi Connaught Place Post Office dispatched under certificate of posting dated September 12 2009 which was submitted by the Noticee.\nThe Noticee has admitted that it does No have the proof of delivery.\nIn terms of regulation 136 of PIT Regulations disclosure is required to be made by the company to the stock exchange s.\nThe next issue for consideration is whether the violation attracts monetary penalty under section 15Ab of SEBI Act and if so what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed on the Noticee.\nThe provisions of section 15 A b of SEBI Act is reproduced here under  Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made there under a ............................... b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less; c ............................... 27.\nIn view of the foregoing I am convinced that it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under section 15Ab of the SEBI Act.\nWhile determining the quantum of monetary penalty under section 15A b I have considered the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under “15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.”\nFrom the material available on record the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage to the Noticee or loss caused to the investors as a result of the default is No quantifiable.\nThe disclosure made under regulation 136 of PIT Regulations by a Company is made public only through Stock Exchange.\nTherefore it is mandatory for the Company to give the required information under the aforesaid regulation to the Stock Exchange so that the said information becomes known to all the investors at large.\nI find from the documents available on record that the disclosure under PIT Regulations was displayed on the website of BSE but with delay due to the failure on the part of Noticee.\nAfter taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case and material available on record I hereby impose a monetary penalty of 20000  Rupees twenty thousand only on the Noticee which will be commensurate with the default committed by it.\nThe Noticee shall pay the said amount of penalty by way of demand draft in favour of “SEBI Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai within 45 days of receipt of this order.\nThe said demand draft shall be forwarded to  Mr Avarjeet Singh Deputy General Manager Integrated Surveillance Department Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI Bhavan Plot No.C4A “G” Block Bandra Kurla Complex Bandra East Mumbai–400 051.\nIn terms of rule 6 of the Rules copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.\nDate October 28 2010 PARAG BASU Place Mumbai ADJUDICATING OFFICER","If any person who is required under this Act or any

Limited CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES 34.\nI have carefully perused the written submissions of the Noticee the submissions made at the hearing and the documents available on record.\nIt is observed that the allegation against the Noticee is that Noticee violated the provisions of Regulation 12 read with Regulation 143 of the Takeover Regulations 1997 pursuant to acquiring 30000 shares 4.08% of the company on March 31 2006 and thereby becoming the sole promoter of the Company.\nWhether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 12 read with Regulation 143 of the Takeover Regulations 1997 pursuant to acquisition of 30000 shares 4.08% of the company on March 31 2006 and thereby becoming the sole promoter of the Company? b.\nIf so do the violations if any attract monetary penalty under Section 15 Hii of the SEBI Act? c.\nIf so what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act?\nBefore moving forward it is pertinent to refer to the definition of “Control” under the Takeover Regulations 1997 and the relevant provisions of Regulation 12 read with Regulation 143 of the Takeover Regulations 1997 which reads as under DEFINITION OF “CONTROL” Definitions 2 1 In these Regulations unless the context otherwise requires a b c control shall include the right to appoint majority of the directors or to control the management or policy decisions exercisable by a person or persons acting individually or in concert directly or indirectly including by virtue of their shareholding or management rights or shareholders agreements or voting agreements or in any other manner;\nAdjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nInnoventive Venture Limited SUBSTANTIAL ACQUISITION OF SHARES OR VOTING RIGHTS IN AND ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OVER A LISTED COMPANY Acquisition of control over a company.\nIrrespective of whether or No there has been any acquisition of shares or voting rights in a company no acquirer shall acquire control over the target company unless such person makes a public announcement to acquire shares and acquires such shares in accordance with the regulations Provided that nothing contained herein shall apply to any change in control which takes place in pursuance to a 1[special resolution] passed by the shareholders in a general meeting Provided further that for passing of the special resolution facility of voting through postal ballot as specified under the Companies Passing of the Resolutions by Postal Ballot Rules 2001 shall also be provided.\nExplanation.—For the purposes of this regulation acquisition shall include direct or indirect acquisition of control of target company by virtue of acquisition of companies whether listed or unlisted and whether in India or abroad.]\nTiming of the public announcement of offer.\n2...... 3 The public announcement referred to in regulation 12 shall be made by the merchant banker No later than four working days after any such change or changes are decided to be made as would result in the acquisition of control over the target company by the acquirer.\nBefore examining the issues listed out as above I note that the Noticee has stated that there is a complete dichotomy between allegation and charges leveled in the SCN and in the supplementary SCN.\nAn adjudicating officer so appointed is required to conduct a quasijudicial enquiry and accordingly penalize or acquit the persons charged.\nThe purpose of show cause notice is Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nI note here that the Noticee has submitted that normally once a SCN is issued and hearing granted necessary Order is passed by the Adjudicating Authority.\nIn the given case supplementary SCN was issued to the Noticee providing further evidence that supported the charge in the SCN.\nAlso pursuant to issue of supplementary SCN an opportunity was granted to the Noticee to submit their reply in the matter.\nAnother opportunity of personal hearing was also provided to the Noticee.\nFurther all submissions made by the Noticee have been taken on record.\nAlso as can be seen from above at every stage an opportunity of personal hearing was given to the Noticee.\nI find that SCN has alleged that the Noticee had acquired 30000 shares 4.08% of the Company on March 31 2006 however failed to make an open offer as required under Regulation 12 read with Regulation 143 of Takeover Regulations 1997.\nOn a perusal of the BSE website I find that from Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nThe Noticee acquired 30000 shares 4.08% of the Company in March 2006 and was classified as the sole promoter of the company in the filing made with BSE.\nIn other words the question to be asked in each case would be whether the acquirer is the driving force behind the company and whether he is the one providing motion to the organization.\nI note from a perusal of the Annual Report and Accounts of the company for the period 200607 and 200708 that the company did No have any business operations during the said period.\nAlso that the company had No appointed any Managing Director or Wholetime Director during the said period.\nFurther the Annual Report of the company for FY 200607 stated that the company was planning long term strategy for revival of its business which inter alia included diversification into lucrative areas.\nIn the matter I find that the Noticee has mentioned that by analyzing the Annual Reports for the year 200607 200708 and 201011 it appeared that the same wordings were getting repeated in all the Annual Reports.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nInnoventive Venture Limited 45.\nI note here that in the Annual Report of 200607 subpara “Future Business Plans of the Company” under the Directors’ Report read as follows “The Company has No received any order during the year under review.\nThe Company is planning long term strategy for revival of its business which inter alia includes diversification into lucrative areas”.\nIn the Annual Report of 200708 the said subpara “Future Business Plans of the Company” under the Directors’ Report got modified and read as follows “The company has considered various action plans and initiated talks for potential profitable businesses and is planning long term strategy for revival of its business which inter alia includes diversification into lucrative areas.”\nThus I find that pursuant to the Noticee being appointed as the promoter of the Company as a first step the company started considering various action plans and initiated talks for potential profitable businesses.\nI find further that the name of the company was changed from Kayton Trade & Finance Ltd to Platinum Ocean Energy Ltd vide Certificate of Change of Name dated June 15 2006 issued by Registrar of Companies hereinafter referred to as ‘RoC’ Mumbai and the company had simultaneously filed an application before the Reserve Bank of India hereinafter referred to as ‘RBI’ for cancellation of NBFC Certificate due to change of name and object clause of the company.\nIt also at the same time altered the Articles of Association and complied with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act.\nThus it is noted that company started orchestrating the change process by taking initial steps such as changing the company name cancelling the NBFC certificate etc. and initiated talks to consider potential profitable businesses.\nThe said momentum for change was received immediately after the Noticee acquired shares of the company on March 31 2006 and was classified as the sole promoter in the filing made by the company with BSE whereas earlier the company did No have any identifiable promoter.\nI find from the submissions made by the Noticee vide letter dated July 15 2014 that Ms. Vineeta Maloo and  Mr Vaibhav Maloo were the promoters of the Noticee at the relevant point of time and they together held 100% shares of the Noticee.\nFurther Ms. Vineeta Maloo was one of the directors of the Noticee from August 16 2005 to February 25 2008  Mr Vaibhav Maloo was one of the directors of the Noticee from January 17 2008 to November 12 2013 and  Mr Hanuman Mal Tater was one of the directors of the Noticee from August 16 2005 to November 12 2013.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nInnoventive Venture Limited 48.\nFrom the Annual Report of the Company for the period 200607 I find that  Mr Manohar Lal Nangalia  Mr Rajesh Malik  Mr Vinod Kapur and  Mr Nirmal Kothari upto May 04 2006 were the Directors of the Company.\nIt is further observed from the Annual Report of the Company for the period 200708 that  Mr Hanuman Mal Tater who was one of the Directors of the Noticee w.e.f August 16 2005 was appointed as an Additional Director of the Company with effect from March 25 2008.\nMr Hanuman Mal Tater was also appointed as a Member on the Audit Committee and on the Shareholders Investors’ Grievance Committee w.e.f March 31 2008.\nBesides it was observed that the earlier remaining Board of Directors comprising of  Mr Manohar Lal Nanagalia  Mr Rajesh Malik and  Mr Vinod Kapur also resigned from the Board around the same time.\nMr Manohar Lal Nanagalia resigned from the Board w.e.f March 25 2008.\nMr Rajesh Malik and  Mr Vinod Kapur resigned from the Board w.e.f March 30 2008.\nFurther as per the Annual Report of 200708 I find that  Mr Jagdish Mal Lodha and  Mr Deepak Bhandari were appointed as NonExecutive Independent Directors w.e.f March 25 2008.\nThus I find from the same that  Mr Hanuman Mal Tater who was one of the Directors of the Noticee became the director w.e.f March 30 2008 who was responsible for day to day management and operations of the Company the other two directors at the relevant point of time being Non Executive and Independent directors.\nIt is pertinent to mention here that as per the Annual Report of period 200607 the Company had No appointed any Managing Director Whole Time Director Manager during the period.\nNeither did the company have any business operations since April 01 2006.\nThe company was planning long term strategy including diversification into lucrative areas during the relevant period and there were no actual business operations.\nI note that the new Board of Directors at its meeting held on June 30 2008 proposed the appointment of R. Kabra & Co. as the statutory auditors in place of Jain Baid & Co. for the financial year 200809.\nIt was further also observed that  Mr Vaibhav Maloo who was the promoter director of the Noticee w.e.f January 17 2008 as per the submissions made by the Noticee was appointed as Director of the Company w.e.f June 30 2009 i.e  the same date when two directors viz.\nMr Hanuman Mal Tater and  Mr Jagdish Mal Lodha resigned from the Company.\nIt is observed from Form 20B for filing of annual return by a Company downloaded from Ministry of Corporate Affairs hereinafter referred to as ‘MCA’ website for the financial years ended March 31 2009 and March 31 2010 that  Mr Vaibhav Maloo had digitally signed the annual return of the Company for both the financial years ended March Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nInnoventive Venture Limited 31 2009 and March 31 2010.\nAlso  Mr Vaibhav Maloo was also appointed as the Chairman on the Audit Committee and on the Shareholders Investors’ Grievance Committee.\nAt this point of time I further find that  Mr Hemant Kumar Sachetee who was the director of the Noticee w.e.f November 15 2006 upto July 11 2007 as per the director details downloaded from MCA website was also appointed as director of the Company w.e.f June 30 2009.\nI find here that the company had accumulated losses at March 31 2006 which were more than 50% of the networth of the Company.\nAs on March 31 2008 the Company issued 240000 Redeemable Preference Shares at a premium of Rs 90 per share to Burlington.\nI find from Form of Annual Return of Burlington downloaded from MCA website as at Annual General Meeting hereinafter referred to as ‘AGM’ dates September 30 2009 and September 30 2010 that rabipaul@hotmail.com was the email address of Burlington mentioned on the said form for both the years.\nI find that the same email address rabipaul@hotmail.com has also been mentioned on Form 20B of Annual Return of the Company as downloaded from MCA website as at financial year ended March 31 2009 AGM date September 30 2009 and at financial year ended March 31 2010 AGM date September 30 2010 which has been digitally signed on behalf of the Company by  Mr Vaibhav Maloo.\nI find from the Annual Return of Burlington that Rabi Paul was one of the directors of Burlington from April 26 2001 and was a director even as on AGM date September 30 2010.\nI also note from DIN DPIN details of  Mr Hanuman Mal Tater downloaded from MCA website that  Mr Hanuman Mal Tater was one of the directors of Burlington from August 01 1992 onwards and continued to be a director of Burlington even as on AGM date September 30 2010.\nIt is pertinent to mention here that  Mr Hanuman Mal Tater was the director of the Noticee from August 16 2005 upto November 12 2013 and director of the Company from March 25 2008 upto June 30 2009.\nFurther I find that 73500 Redeemable Preference Shares of the Company at a premium of Rs 90 per share were also issued to Amrit.\nI note from Annual Return of Amrit as at AGM date September 20 2008 downloaded from MCA website that  Mr Panna Lal Maloo was one of the Directors of Amrit from September 09 2005 and  Mr Vinay Kumar Maloo was one of the directors of Amrit since January 03 2008 upto March 07 2008.\nFurther I note that that  Mr Panna Lal Maloo is a close relative of  Mr Vaibhav Maloo and Ms. Vineeta Maloo the promoters directors of the Noticee at the relevant point mailtorabipaul@hotmail.com mailtorabipaul@hotmail.com Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nInnoventive Venture Limited of time.\nThe said relation has been illustrated below 54.\nAlso from the list of top 100 shareholders of Burlington as at September 29 2007 and September 30 2009 downloaded from MCA website I find that the top 100 shareholders included the following Name s Number of Shares held in Burlington Amrit Sales Promotion Pvt Ltd 172000  Mr Panna Lal Maloo 30000  Mr Vaibhav Maloo 13940 Ms. Vineeta Maloo 996 55.\nI further find from Annual Return of Amrit as at AGM date September 20 2008 downloaded from MCA website that the shareholders of Amrit included  Mr Panna Lal Maloo holding 29000 shares of Rs 10 each  Mr Sanjay Maloo holding 29420 shares of Rs 10 each Burlington holding 155000 shares of Rs 10 each and 20000 shares of Rs 100 each.\nRukmanand Maloo Father Banechand Maloo son Vinay Maloo son Vaibhav Maloo son Vineet Maloo daughterin law Pannalal Mallo son Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nInnoventive Venture Limited 56.\nThus I note here that Noticee through its promoters directors and their relatives had direct relationship with Burlington and Amrit to whom Redeemable Preference Shares were issued by the Company.\nFrom the Annual Report of the company for FY 200708 I find that the networth of the company was approx. Rs 3.87 crore.\nThus I find that funds contributed by Burlington Rs 24000000 and Amrit Rs 7350000 for acquiring the redeemable preference shares of the company at a premium of Rs 90 per share constituted 80% of the networth of the company.\nHowever subsequently the financial position of the company deteriorated to such an extent that as per the Annual Report of FY 201011 I find that the company had accumulated losses which were more than 100% of the networth of the company.\nThus I find that in accordance to provisions contained under section 31o of the Sick Industrial Companies Special Provisions Act 1985 SICA the Company deemed to be a sick industrial company in FY 201011.\nAt this stage I find from the Annual Report of the company for FY 201011 that the company took interest free loan of Rs 32500000 out of business expediency from Obident and gave interest free loan out of business expediency to Burlington and Amrit.\nThis interest free loan that the company gave to Burlington and Amrit was equivalent to the funds contributed by these two firms for acquiring the redeemable preference shares as per the details given below Sr.\nBurlington Finance Pvt Ltd 24000000 2 M s.\nAmrit Sales Promotion Pvt Ltd 7350000 Total 31350000 59.\nI find it pertinent to mention here that Auditor’s Report for FY 201011 had also highlighted the fact that interest free loans given by the company were prejudicial to the interest of the company.\nThus I note that the company which was deemed sick instead of taking steps in the best interest of the Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nSubsequently as per the Annual Report of the company for FY 201112 I find that the company redeemed 313500 redeemable preference shares of Rs 10 each at premium of Rs 90 each issued to Burlington and Amrit.\nI find further that the consideration was adjusted against the debit balance of the preference shareholders Burlington and Amrit.\nThe Auditors Report of Obident for the year ended March 30 2011 downloaded from MCA website showed Rs 3.25 crore given and repaid during the year as loan transaction done with related parties associate concern.\nFurther the Annual Report of the Company for FY 201112 at Note 5 to ‘Notes to Financial Statements’ shows an amount of Rs 9231 payable to Elan Capital Advisors i.e  earlier Obident.\nThe Noticee subsequently sold the company to  Mr Chandu Chavan & Ors.\nThe directors who were already there prior to their said acquisition continued to manage the Company.\nMr Jagdish Mal Lodha  Mr Deepak Bhandari  Mr Hanuman Mal Tater  Mr Vaibhav Maloo and  Mr Hemant Kumar Sachetee.\nThe Company has stated that they were unable to locate the copies of specific notices received by the Company from Members under section 257 of the Companies Act 1956.\nInnoventive Venture Limited preference shares at a premium of Rs 90 per share to Burlington and 73500 redeemable preference shares at a premium of Rs 90 per share to Amrit has No been provided by the Company.\nFurther I note that the Noticee has stated that there was no agreement in respect of the 30000 shares 4.08% purchased by it from  Mr Hanuman Mal Anchalia HUF by way of offmarket transaction that resulted in alleged violation of Regulation 12 read with Regulation 143 of the Takeover Regulations 1997.\nI find from the Annual Report of the Company for FY 200506 that the company had accumulated losses at March 31 2006 which were more than 50% of the networth of the Company.\nThe company did No have any business operations.\nThere were no fixed assets in the company.\nThe Company did No have any identifiable promoter immediately prior to the Noticee acquiring shares in the company and being named as the promoter of the company.\nUpon Noticee being named as the sole promoter pursuant to its acquisition of shares it is however observed that the company started considering various action plans and initiated talks for potential profitable businesses for its revival.\nIt is further observed that pursuant to the Noticee acquiring 4.08% shares and becoming the sole promoter of the company the business object of the company went through a major change whereby the NBFC business was closed down and company started looking for lucrative opportunities in petroleum and exploration business.\nFurther by March 30 2008 the entire earlier Board of Directors resigned.\nHe was also appointed as a Member of the Audit Committee and on the Shareholders Investors’ Grievance Committee.\nThe company at the point of time did No have any other Managing Director or Wholetime Director on the Board of Directors.\nI find here that the Noticee has claimed that it was No involved in Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nThe company did No have any business operations.\nAnd at such point of time I find that the promoter director of the Noticee was the Director of the Company as also the Chairman of the Audit Committee & Shareholders Investor Grievance Committee.\nThe Company stated that fresh equity was raised during 201112 to the extent of Rs 14.42 crore Rs 10.42 crore by way of Swap and Rs 4.00 crore in cash and equity raised in cash was used for repayment of loan of Rs 32500000  raised from Obident in the interim.\nThough the Company stated that bank statements supporting the same would be made available in due course of time however the same have No been provided.\nI note Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nInnoventive Venture Limited further that the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee TRAC in its report dated July 19 2010 had also reiterated the above views of the Bhagwati Committee.\nBesides as per Regulation 21h of Takeover Regulations 1997 ‘promoter’ inter alia means any person who is in control of the target company.\nInnoventive Venture Limited company was No having any business operations at the point of time there were no fixed assets in the company and no inventory.\nIn view of the foregoing I am convinced that it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under Section 15Hii of the SEBI Act for the violation of Regulation 12 read with 14 of the Takeover Regulations 1997 against the Noticee which reads as under Penalty for nondisclosure of acquisition of shares and takeovers.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder fails to— i .......... ii make a public announcement to acquire shares at a minimum price; or iii ......... iv ............ he shall be liable to a penalty of twentyfive crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of such failure whichever is higher.\nWhile determining the quantum of monetary penalty under Section 15Hii of the SEBI Act I have considered the factors stipulated in Section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nWhile adjudging quantum of penalty under Section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\n‘‘Explanation.—For the removal of doubts it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E clauses b and c of section 15F 15G 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.’’.\nIn view of the charges as established the facts and circumstances of the case and the judgments referred to and mentioned hereinabove the quantum of penalty would depend on the factors referred in Section 15J of SEBI Act and stated as above.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nAs per Section 15Hii of the SEBI Act the Noticee is liable to a penalty of twentyfive crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of such failure whichever is higher.\nI have taken note of the fact brought on record by the Noticee that they had a clean record in terms of compliance.\nI have taken note of the fact put forth by the Noticee that as per Letter of Offer dated December 03 2011 filed by the buyers taking the date of March 31 2006 as the trigger date and adding interest @10% p.a. the offer price would have become Rs 8.62 per share only which is far lower than the offer price of Rs 10 per share which the buyers had offered in 2011.\nHowever I find it pertinent to mention here that the shareholders are entitled to receive interest for the delay involved in receiving the payment of the consideration amount for the period from the date on which it was due till the date on which the actual payment is made.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nInnoventive Venture Limited 82.\nIn order to ascertain the loss caused if any to the shareholders who would have sold shares pursuant to acquisition of shares in the Company by the Noticee on March 2006 and prior to the public announcement made by the Acquirer  Mr Chandu Chavan & Ors. the Company and its present Registrars were advised to provide such details along with the quantum and price at which the shares were sold.\nHowever despite issue of summons to the Company and the present Registrars the said details were No forthcoming from the Company.\nHence the exact loss caused if any to the shareholders who would have sold shares prior to the open offer by Acquirer  Mr Chandu Chavan & Ors could No be ascertained.\nPublic announcement as envisaged under Regulation 12 read with Regulation 14 of the Takeover Regulations 1997 is the announcement of the open offer by the acquirers and the persons acting in concert primarily disclosing their intention to acquire shares of the target company from the existing shareholders thereby giving an opportunity of exit to the public shareholders at a specified price during a specified time.\nIn fact I find that the penalty provision under Section 15H ii of the SEBI Act also specifically refers to failure to “make a public announcement to acquire shares at a minimum price”.\nAfter taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case I impose a penalty of Rs 5000000  Rupees Fifty Lakhs only on the Noticee viz.\nCapetown Trading Company Private Limited under the provisions of Section 15Hii of the SEBI Act for violation of Regulation 12 read with Regulation 14 of the Takeover Regulations 1997.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nInnoventive Venture

regarding No execution of these orders to the stock exchange as required under Clause 2.1 of Schedule II of Regulation 122 of PIT 1992 and Clause 367 of Listing Agreement r w section 21 of SCRA.\nIt was therefore alleged in the SCN that the Noticee 1 and its directors Noticee No 2 to 4 have violated the provisions of Clause 367 of Listing Agreement r w section 21 of SCRA Clause 2.1 of Schedule II of Regulation 122 of PIT 1992 to be adjudged under Section 23A a of SCRA and Section 15HB of the SEBI Act and Noticee No 5 its Compliance officer  has violated the provisions of Clause 3.2 of Schedule

violation if any attract monetary penalty under Section 23A a of SCRA and Section 15HB of the SEBI Act? c If so what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act?\nAdjudication Order in matter ofShreeyash Industries Ltd Ltd. 18.\nBefore proceeding further I would like to refer to the relevant provisions of law which read as under Regulation 12 of PIT 1992 states as under Code of internal procedures and conduct for listed companies and other entities.\n1 All listed companies and organisations associated with securities markets including a the intermediaries as mentioned in section 12 of the Act asset management company and trustees of mutual funds ; b the selfregulatory organisations recognised or authorised by the Board; c the recognised stock exchanges and clearing house or corporations; d the public financial institutions as defined in section 4A of the Companies Act 1956; and e the

information.”\nSection 21 of SCRA states as under Adjudication Order in matter ofShreeyash Industries Ltd Ltd. “Where securities are listed on the application of any person in any recognised stock exchange such person shall comply with the conditions of the listing agreement with that stock exchange.”\nNOTICEE 1 19.\nThe main charge against Noticee 1 is that it had failed to disclose regarding No execution of the orders bagged by the Company and allegedly violated Clause 367 of Listing Agreement r w section 21 SCRA Clause 2.1 of Schedule II of Regulation 122 of PIT 1992.\nI note from facts on record that Noticee 1 received four Orders on different dates which were informed to Stock Exchange on various dates as mentioned in the table below.\nDate of Order Name of Buyer Order Value Rs in Crores Date of Intimation to stock exchange 13.02.2012 M s Trade Point New Delhi Rs 6.96 14.02.2012 20.06.2012 M s Colombo Trade Italy Rs 21.30 25.06.2012 06.07.2012 M s Silver Solution South Africa Rs 23.92 09.07.2012 16.07.2012 Hapan Trade South Africa Rs 24 17.07.2012 21.\nIn note that Noticee 1 on its own intimated information to stock exchange immediately regarding bagging of large Orders as mentioned above.\nIt clearly indicates that Noticee 1 had recognised the event of bagging of orders as price sensitive information and accordingly intimated to stock exchange.\nThe price volume spurt as mentioned in table above after announcement corroborate the price sensitivity of said information.\nDuring the course of investigations Noticee 1 was advised to provide update on the status of Orders along with reasons for nonexecution of Orders.\nNoticee 1 Adjudication Order in matter ofShreeyash Industries Ltd Ltd. vide letter dated July 18 2014 submitted following reasons for nonexecution of Order along with status of same.\nNo Date of Announcement Particular of Announcement Reasons for No Adherence 1 13.02.2012 Shreeyash lndustries Limited Bags large order from New Delhi based company for mens Tshirts of value of Rs 695  lakhs.\nOrder should be completed in 3 months.\nWhile the transactions for acquisition of SMM Paper Marketing Pvt Ltd. was going on talks were held for supply orders which materialized in July 2012 and announcement was made accordingly.\nHowever it had intended to execute the Orders serial number 2 3 and 4 by using plants machinery manpower of proposed acquisition of SMM Paper Marketing Private ltd SMM.\nHowever Noticee 1 did No submit any documents to suggest that they approached bankers to get working capital.\nFrom the submissions of Noticee 1 as mentioned above I note that it had accepted large Orders in the backdrop of proposed acquisition of SMM which was in progress at the time of receipt such Orders.\nIt is essential to note all the relevant events relating to acquisition of SMM.\nThe chronology based on documents available on records are under. a Noticee 1 entered into MOU with SMM on January 19 2012 for purchase of entire shareholding of SMM at agreed valuation as decided by Independent Valuation expert.\nCopy of MOU’s was also submitted as proof.\nAdjudication Order in matter ofShreeyash Industries Ltd Ltd. b Thereafter Noticee 1in its Board meeting held on February 1 2012 considered and approved the acquisition of SMM Ruthvik Nursaries and Agro Chemicals and Anu Traders for a valuation of Rs 23.66 crores 48 lakhs and 1.30 crores respectively and decided to allocate shares on preferential basis to them. c The said decision was informed to BSE on the same day which was also put on BSE website and available in public domain. d Thereafter Noticee 1 applied for inprinciple approval to BSE for listing of preferential shares in the Month of March 2012. e SMM vide letter dated July 10 2012 communicated termination of agreement citing market conditions besides various other reasons. f Subsequently Noticee 1 vide letter dated July 11 2012 informed BSE regarding the termination of the acquisitions as mentioned above and withdrew its inprinciple application for preferential offer pending with BSE.\nFrom the above I note that there Noticee 1 entered into MOU agreement for the purpose of acquisition and also decided to allot shares on preference basis at agreed price.\nThe decision of the Board of Noticee 1 held on February 1 2012 was also informed to BSE on the same day which was also available in public domain.\nNoticee 1 also applied for inprinciple approval from BSE in the month of March 2017.\nNoticee 1 submitted that the information regarding cancellation of MOU with SMM was informed to stock exchange and therefore in public domain.\nI note that Noticee 1 vide letter dated July 11 2012 had informed BSE regarding the termination of MOU with SMM in the context of withdrawal of its inprinciple application pending before BSE.\nNoticee 1 did No separate disclosure to BSE as required under listing agreement and therefore it cannot be said that Noticee 1 had informed the details of termination of agreement to the public.\nI note that the main charge alleged in the SCN relates to nondisclosure of Adjudication Order in matter ofShreeyash Industries Ltd Ltd. cancellation of Orders.\nHowever I consider it relevant to note the events in entirety in the context of submissions by Noticee 1 which lead to cancellation of Orders.\nNoticee 1 submitted that they were contemplating to use the plant machinery and manpower of SMM for execution of Orders.\nI note that Noticee 1 received its first Order in the month February 2012 and another Order in the month of June 2012 and two Orders in the month of July 2012.\nI note that all these Orders except the last Order received on July 16 2012 were received while the process of acquisition was in progress.\nThe copies of the purchase order received from all four clients were submitted along with correspondence made received by from noticee clients regarding pending orders.\nI details of the purchase Orders are reproduced as under.\nIt was also stated that companies earlier plan to take over SMM Paper Marketing Private Limited which the company intended to use plant machinery and manpower for execution of aforesaid Orders.\nHowever said takeover did No materialise.\nI note that information regarding bagging of large Orders of large value if executed would have had material effect on balance sheet of company and therefore considered as material price sensitive information and required to disclose to stock exchange as mandated in clause 367 of listing agreement.\nI note that Noticee 1 have promptly disclosed the information regarding bagging of Orders in public domain without any delay.\nFurther the information regarding preferential offer to SMM was also in public domain.\nFrom the above events I note that agreement with SMM was terminated on July 10 2012 and the Orders valued Rs 45 crores 90% of total order value expired by August 2012 as they were required to be delivered within one month from date of Order as per the terms of the purchase Order.\nFurther I also conclude that Noticee 1was in possession of information regarding nonexecution cancellation of Orders in the month of July August 2012.\nHowever Noticee 1 failed to make disclose to public regarding till November 2014.\nThus there was considerable delay for more than 2 years in disclosing the information to public which affected investors as is evident from item 1 of the Minutes of 18th Annual General Meeting of SIL held on December 31 2012 that shareholders namely Surendra Mishra Praful Chavda and Mr Bhara Shah have raised question relating to acquisition of M s SMM paper Marketing Pvt Ltd M s Ruthvik Industries M s Agro Chemical and M s Anu Traders along with the status of execution of various orders namely Tradepoint Columbo etc. 32.\nNOTICEE 2 TO 4 33.\nThe main charge against Noticee 24 is that they had failed to disclose regarding No execution of the orders bagged by the Company and allegedly violated Adjudication Order in matter ofShreeyash Industries Ltd Ltd.

HOLDING INQUIRY AND IMPOSING PENALTIES BY ADJUDICATING OFFICER RULES 1995 In respect of Shri Parag Kishorekumar Ajmera PAN ABIPA4469L In the matter of Multi Commodity Exchange of India Limited FACTS OF THE CASE IN BRIEF 1.\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India SEBI conducted investigation in the scrip of Multi Commodity Exchange of India Limited hereinafter referred to as “Company MCX” for the period of April 27 2012 to July 31 2013.\nIt was observed in investigation that National Spot Exchange Limited NSEL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Financial Technologies India Ltd “FTIL” which also holds 26% of the shareholding in MCX.\nFurther all three companies i.e  NSEL FTIL and MCX are under a common management with common directors and employees.\nA Show Cause Notice dated April 27 2012 was issued by the Department of Consumer Affairs DCA SCN to NSEL.\nAs per the Investigating Authority the Unpublished Price Sensitive Information “UPSI” in respect of the shares of MCX was the implication of the DCA SCN dated April 27 2012 issued to NSEL i.e  suspension of short selling by its Members pairing of contracts and settlement of contracts beyond 11 Adjudication Order in respect of Parag K Ajmera in the matter of MCX days and impending payment defaults by the members of NSEL and loss of reputation of Promoters and Management of MCX.\nIt was observed that any news impacting business of NSEL will automatically impact share price of its holding company i.e  FTIL and associate companies i.e  MCX and any news impacting credentials of Promoters and Management of FTIL NSEL and MCX will also impact the share price of MCX therefore suspension of trading by NSEL was a negative news.\nAs per the Investigating Authority the UPSI came into existence on April 27 2012 upon the issuance of the SCN to NSEL by the DCA and it ceased to exist when NSEL suspended trading in all contracts except eseries contracts and deferred settlement of all pending contracts on July 31 2013.\nFTIL being the holding company of NSEL Directors and Officers of FTIL were reasonably expected of having access to the UPSI which emanated from its wholly owned subsidiary company i.e  NSEL.\nIt was observed in the investigation conducted by SEBI that Shri Parag Kishorekumar Ajmera “Noticee” was a senior level employee of FTIL during UPSI period i.e  he was Chief Business Officer of FTIL since November 02 2001.\nNoticee was also brother of Shri Paras K Ajmera who was holding senior level position of DirectorOperations and HR of FTIL since October 01 2005.\nIn that capacity Noticee was reasonably expected of having access to the UPSI which emanated from NSEL and thus an insider under SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 hereinafter referred to as PIT Regulations 1992.\nIt was alleged that the Noticee being an insider before the outbreak of NSEL irregularities avoided losses by selling 300 shares of MCX on November 30 2012 when in possession of UPSI and thereby violated provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992 read with Adjudication Order in respect of Parag K Ajmera in the matter of MCX Regulation 122 of SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 2015 hereinafter referred to as “PIT Regulations 2015”.\nThe undersigned was appointed as Adjudicating Officer under section 15I of the Securities and Exchange Board of

‘Adjudication Rules’ to inquire into and adjudge under section 15G of the SEBI Act the alleged violations of provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992 read with Regulation 122 of PIT

to the Noticee under Rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should No be initiated and penalty be No imposed under section 15G of the SEBI Act 1992 for the alleged violations specified in the SCN.\nVide letters dated January 12 and March 20 2018 Joby Mathew & Associates Advocates filed reply to the SCN on behalf of the Noticee.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 9.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the present case are  I. Whether Noticee avoided losses by selling 300 shares of MCX on November 30 2012 when in possession of UPSI and thereby violated provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992? and II.\nDoes the violation if any attract monetary penalty under section 15G of SEBI Act?\nBefore moving forward it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of PIT Regulations 1992 which reads as under “Prohibition on dealing communicating or counselling on matters relating to insider trading.\nNo insider shall— i either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person deal in securities of a company listed on any stock exchange when in possession of any unpublished price sensitive information; or” 11.\nI have perused the written submissions of the Noticee documents available on record and the WTM order dated January 05 2018 in the same matter in different proceedings.\nHaving considered the same I record my findings hereunder.\nI find that Noticee was Chief Business Officer of FTIL since November 02 2001 and also brother of Shri Paras K Ajmera who was holding senior level position of DirectorOperations and HR of FTIL since October 01 2005.\nIn that capacity Noticee was reasonably expected of having access to the UPSI which emanated from NSEL.\nFurther the transactions in question i.e  sale of 300 shares of MCX on November 30 2012 as specified in the SCN is also a matter of record.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Parag K Ajmera in the matter of MCX 13.\nNoticee has brought to my attention the fact that WTM of SEBI vide Order dated January 05 2018 under sections 111 114b and 11B of SEBI Act on the same set of facts and allegations had exonerated certain individuals in a separate proceedings against them in the scrip of MCX and the period of UPSI was the same as in the SCN in the instant adjudication proceedings.\nI note that in the said WTM order there was a specific finding with regard to the periodicity of the UPSI which is as under “25.\nHaving answered the first issue in the affirmative the next issue for consideration is whether the “price sensitive information” was unpublished during the period of investigation.\nIn this regard it is noted that on October 3 2012 an article appeared in the Economic Times a widely distributed financial newspaper which contained information relating to the issuance of SCN dated April 27 2012 to NSEL majority of the contents of the SCN allegations against NSEL with regard to violation of conditions of DCA notification dated June 5 2007 and the gist of NSEL’s reply to the SCN.\nThe article also covered the possible action that could be taken by DCA against NSEL i.e  withdrawal of exemption granted to NSEL vide the notification dated June 5 2007.\nIt was also alleged that NSEL did No have a stock check facility for validating a members position.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Parag K Ajmera in the matter of MCX  NSEL had filed its reply to the SCN issued by DCA.\nThe article categorically mentioned that failure on part of NSEL to provide a satisfactory explanation to the allegations levelled in the SCN would result in withdrawal of exemption granted to NSEL vide notification dated June 5 2007.\nThe said withdrawal of exemption in turn would have had a cascading effect on the contracts being traded on NSEL payment defaults in relation thereto and the eventual loss to the reputation of the promoters management of NSEL.\nIn terms of rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules copies of this order are sent to Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.\nDate April 27 2018 Prasanta Mahapatra Place Mumbai Adjudicating Officer","", "The undersigned was appointed as Adjudicating Officer under section 15I of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992 hereinafter referred to as “SEBI Act” read with rule 3 of SEBI Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalty by Adjudicating Officer Rules 1995 hereinafter referred to as the ‘Adjudication Rules’ to inquire into and adjudge under section 15G of the SEBI Act the alleged violations of provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992 read with Regulation 122 of PIT Regulations 2015 by the Noticee."))

Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992 of read with Regulation 122 of PIT Regulations 2015 by the Noticee.\nSHOW CAUSE NOTICE REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 3.\nA Show Cause Notice dated December 14 2017 hereinafter referred to as “SCN” was issued to the Noticee under Rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should No be initiated and penalty be No imposed under section 15Ab of the SEBI Act 1992 for the alleged violations specified in the SCN.\nAfter considering the reply of the Noticee the allegations regarding violation of Regulation 3i an order was passed by me on February 1 2018 and while disposing off the SCN partly it was decided that the allegation regarding failure to make necessary disclosure will be decided separately after hearing the Noticee.\nThe Noticee submitted a reply on January 12 2018 and his major submissions as regards delay in making disclosures under Reg.\nAn opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on August 21 2018 in accordance with Rule 43 of the AO Rules.\nThe Noticee and his authorized representative appeared on the said date and made oral Adjudication Order in respect of Joseph Massey in the matter of MCX submissions.\nThe Noticee also sought three days time to file written submissions.\nThe written submissions have been sent by the Noticee vide letter dated August 27 2018.\nThe summary of relevant written submissions and submissions made during the course of hearing is as follows a.\nThe Noticee has suffered irreparable loss due to the exparte order of SEBI. b.\nThe Noticee was allotted 31240 shares of MCX and he intended to sell 10000 shares which was also disclosed by MCX in its prospectus dated February 28 2012.\nThe sale of shares was in accordance with the said disclosures and the delay was inadvertent. c.\nThe disclosures pertain to sale of shares which were insignificant as compared to the share capital.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 7.\nI have carefully perused the reply to the SCN and oral submissions of the Noticee and the documents available on record.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the present case are  a Whether the Noticee failed to make any disclosure as envisaged in Reg. 134 of the PIT Regulations? and b Does the violation if any attract monetary penalty under section 15Ab of SEBI Act?\nBefore moving forward it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of PIT Regulations which reads as under PIT REGULATIONS Adjudication Order in respect of Joseph Massey in the matter of MCX Continual Disclosure 134 Any person who is a director or officer of a listed company shall disclose to the company and the stock exchange where the securities are listed in Form D the total number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights if there has been a change in such holdings of such person and his dependents as defined by the company from the last disclosure made under subregulation 2 or under this sub regulation and the change exceeds Rs 5 lakh in value or 25000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower. 135.\nThe disclosure mentioned in subregulations 3 4 and 4A shall be made within two working days of a the receipts of intimation of allotment of shares or b the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights as the case may be.\nFINDINGS 9.\nIt is seen from the Investigation Report hereinafter referred to as “IR” and the relevant documents that the Noticee has sold a total of 11250 shares of MCX during the investigation period on 7 dates viz.\nApril 24 2012 May 4 2012 June 1 2012 November 6 2012 November 7 2012 February 25 2013 and June 28 2013.\nAs per the SCN delayed disclosures under Reg. 134 have been made for sale of shares done on May 5 2012 and February 25 2013.\nThe Noticee was a director of MCX and hence was obligated to make a disclosure on sale of shares.\nThe delay in disclosure by the Noticee is as follows Adjudication Order in respect of Joseph Massey in the matter of MCX Date of Transacti on No of share s sold Amount In ₹  Date when disclosure should have made to MCX as well as exchange as per Reg. 134 Actual date of Disclosure to MCX Actual date of Disclosure to BSE Delay in disclos ure to MCX Delay in disclosu re to BSE 04.05.2012 1000 1020000 08.05.2012 11.05.2012 17.05.2012 3 days 9 days 25.02.2013 2000 2330000 27.02.2013 01.03.2013 01.03.2013 2 days 2 days 11.\nIn view of the above the next issue for consideration is as to what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed on the Noticee for the violation of Sec.\n15Ab of the SEBI Act which reads as under Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder — a... b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty which shall No be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees;\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act it is important to consider the factors relevantly as stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act which read as under Section 15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15 the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely Adjudication Order in respect of Joseph Massey in the matter of MCX a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nIn this matter it is noted that the Noticee had made his intent clear regarding the sale of shares of MCX in the prospectus itself and hence no ulterior motive or disproportionate gain for delayed disclosure can be attributed to the Noticee.\nFurther as the quantity of shares is No significant no quantifiable loss seem to have been caused to the investors.\nIn view of the above after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and exercising the powers conferred upon me under Section 15 I 2 of the SEBI Act 1992 read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules I hereby impose monetary penalty of Rs

October 01 2012 to December 31 2012 it was observed that the Noticee had sold all his holdings i.e  110000 shares and thereby his shareholding in the company became zero.\nIn view of the same the

notice dated July 11 2014 hereinafter referred to as the „SCN‟ was issued to the Noticee in terms of Rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules requiring him to show cause as to why an inquiry should No be held against him for the alleged violation.\nThe said SCN was sent to the Noticee by Registered Post and the same was delivered report from the Department of post is available on record.\nHowever it was noted that the Noticee had No filed any reply to the said SCN.\nThereafter in the interest of natural justice and in order to conduct an inquiry as per Rule 43 of the Adjudication Rules an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on March 26 2015.\nShri Suresh Kumar Chairman of CDI attended the said hearing on the scheduled date on behalf of the Noticee and made oral

on behalf of the Noticee has been couriered in respect to the present matter.\nHowever no clarification letter has been received in this regard till date.\nI find that the Noticee has been granted ample time to submit his additional reply in the matter.\nTherefore I am proceeding further against the Noticee on the basis of material available on record in the matter.\nConsideration of Issues Evidence and Findings 7.\nI have carefully perused the charges against the Noticee as per the SCN written submissions and the materials as available on record.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the present case are a Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 134A read with 135 of the PIT Regulations? b Does the violation if any on the part of the Noticee attract any penalty under Sections 15Ab of the SEBI Act? c If yes what should be the quantum of penalty?\nBefore moving forward it will be appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions of PIT Regulations which read as under Relevant provisions of PIT Regulations 134A Any person who is a promoter or part of promoter group of a listed company shall disclose to the company and the stock exchange where the securities are listed in Form D the total number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights if there has been a change in such holdings of such person from the last disclosure made under Listing Agreement or under subregulation 2A or under this sub regulation and the change exceeds Rs 5 lakh in value or 25000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower.\n5 The disclosure mentioned in subregulations 3 4 and 4A shall be made within two working days of a the receipts if intimation of allotment of shares or b the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights as the case may be.\nI find from the SCN that CDI is a listed company and the shares of the company are traded on BSE.\nFurther during the period of examination it was alleged that the Noticee had transacted in the shares of CDI and the details of the same are as under Date Transac tion Type Dr Cr Holding prior to transaction Transacte d quantity Holding after transaction Chang e in holdin g in term of % 30 09 2012 110000 0 110000 0.86 1 10 2012 31 12 12 Transfer D 110000 110000 0 0 10.\nFrom the above table I note that the Noticee was holding 110000 shares constituting for 0.86% of the total paid up capital of CDI on September 30 2012.\nDuring the period from October 01 2012 to December 31 2012 the Noticee sold all his holdings in the company i.e  110000 shares which resulted in his holding coming to zero.\nUpon the said change in the shareholding the Noticee being the director promoter of CDI was under an obligation to make necessary disclosures to the company and the stock exchange as prescribed under Regulation 134A read with Regulation 135 of the PIT Regulations.\nIt was alleged that the Noticee had failed to do so.\nVide letter dated April 15 2015 the Noticee submitted his reply to the SCN and stated that complete disclosures were made to the stock exchange through company announcements including details of weekly trades with quantities.\nHowever I note that no documentary evidence has been provided by the Noticee in support thereof.\nUpon further perusal of the documents as available on record I find that vide e mails dated January 30 2014 and July 14 2014 BSE has confirmed that the Noticee has No made the requisite disclosures and that the exchange has No received any disclosures from the Noticee.\nAlso I do No find any merit in the submission of the Noticee that necessary disclosures were made to the stock exchange with respect to the transfer of shares as no documentary evidence in support of the said contention has been submitted by the Noticee.\nFurther no documentary evidence has been submitted by the Chairman and Managing Director of CDI in support of the submission that the Noticee had resigned from the company in F. Y. 20092010 itself.\nPenalty for failure to furnish information return etc. If any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made there under a.... b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefore in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefore in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.\nI note that the objective of the disclosure provisions laid down under the PIT Regulations is to keep the investors and public at large informed of the change in the holdings of any company.\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of the SEBI Act which reads as under 15J ‐ Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15‐I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely‐ a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nThe disclosure made under Regulation 134A read with Regulation 135 of the PIT Regulations by a promoter is made public only through Stock Exchange.\nTherefore dissemination of complete information on all the stock exchanges where the securities are listed is a mandatory requirement.\nIn view of the above after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and exercising the powers conferred upon me under Section 15I 2 of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules I impose a penalty of 200000  Rupees Two Lakh Only on the Noticee viz.\nShri Vinod Kumar under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act in the matter.\nThe penalty amount as mentioned above shall be paid by the Noticee through a duly crossed demand draft drawn in favour of “SEBI – Penalties Remittable to Government of India” and payable at Mumbai within 45 days of receipt of this order.\nThe said demand draft should be forwarded to the Division Chief ISD Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI Bhavan Plot No C4A „G‟ Block Bandra Kurla Complex Bandra E Mumbai – 400 051.\nIn terms of the Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules copies of this order are sent to Noticee and also to Securities and Exchange Board of India.\nDate July 31 2015 D.

the submissions made at the time of hearing and the documents available on record.\nWhether the promoters Noticees failed to make disclosures under Regulation 71A read with 72 of the Takeover Regulations within the stipulated time? b.\nWhether the Noticee promoters viz.\nDo the violations if any attract monetary penalty under Section 15 Ab of SEBI Act? d.\nIf so what would be the monetary

target company and the stock exchange within two days of creation of pledge.\n2 The disclosures mentioned in subregulations 1 and 1A shall be made within two days of— a the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares; or b the acquisition of shares or voting rights as the case may be.\nAdjudication in the matter of M s.\nWW Technology Holdings Ltd 11.\n1 Between October 24 2001 and September 8 2002 i.e  at time of acquisition by Shri Saritadevi Mansingka No acquirer who together with persons acting in concert with him has acquired in accordance with the provisions of law 15 per cent or more but less than 75 per cent of the shares or voting rights in a company shall acquire either by himself or through or with persons acting in concert with him additional shares or voting rights entitling him to exercise more than 10 per cent of the voting rights in any period of twelve months unless such acquirer makes a public announcement to acquire shares in accordance with the regulations Between October 1 2002 and December 29 2004 i.e  at time of acquisition by Shri Prashant Deorah Shri Anil Patodia Ms. Poonam Patodia Shri Kishorilal Patodia Shri Abhijeet Patodia No acquirer who together with persons acting in concert with him has acquired in accordance with the provisions of law 15 per cent or more but less than 75 per cent of the shares or voting rights in a company shall acquire either by himself or through or with persons acting in concert with him additional shares or voting rights entitling him to exercise more than 5 per cent of the voting rights in any financial year ending on 31st March unless such acquirer makes a public announcement to acquire shares in accordance with the regulations.\nPost November 6 2009 till notification of SEBI Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations 2011 i.e  at the time of acquisition by Shri Divansh Mansingka No acquirer who together with persons acting in concert with him has acquired in accordance with the provisions of law 15 per cent or more but less than fifty five per cent 55% of the shares or voting rights in a company shall acquire either by himself or through or with persons acting in concert with him additional shares or voting rights entitling him to exercise more than 5% of the voting rights with post acquisition shareholding or voting rights No exceeding fifty five per cent. in any financial year ending on 31st March unless such acquirer makes a public announcement to acquire shares in accordance with the regulations.\nAdjudication in the matter of M s.\nWW Technology Holdings Ltd Timing of the public announcement of offer.\n1 The public announcement referred to in regulation 10 or regulation 11 shall be made by the merchant banker No later than four working days of entering into an agreement for acquisition of shares or voting rights or deciding to acquire shares or voting rights exceeding the respective percentage specified therein 1[Provided that in case of disinvestment of a Public Sector Undertaking the public announcement shall be made by the merchant banker No later than 4 working days of the acquirer executing the Share Purchase Agreement or Shareholders Agreement with the Central Government 2[or the State Government as the case may be] for the acquisition of shares or voting rights exceeding the percentage of shareholding referred to in regulation 10 or regulation 11 or the transfer of control over a target Public Sector Undertaking.]\nThe first issue for consideration is whether the promoters Noticees failed to make disclosures under Regulation 71A read with 72 of the Takeover Regulations 1997 within the stipulated time.\nAs per the additional details mentioned in the table under Para 4 above I observe that Ms. Saritadevi Mansingka purchased 6750 shares of the company on September 2 2002.\nPrior to the said purchase the shareholding of the Promoter group stood at 43.89% and increased to 46.64% post the purchase of shares.\nAs noted above at the time of the acquisition by Ms. Saritadevi Mansingka Regulation 71A required that any acquirer who has acquired shares or voting rights of a company under subregulation 1 of Regulation 11 shall make disclosures of such acquisition as well as the aggregate of his pre and post acquisition of share holding and voting rights to the company when such acquisition aggregates to 5% and 10% of the voting rights.\nThus in terms of the provisions of Regulation 71A as it stood at the relevant point of time disclosure was required to be made if the acquisition exceeded 5% and 10%.\nThe acquisition of Ms. Saritadevi Mansingka represented 2.76% of the shares of the company.\n1 Inserted by the SEBI Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Amendment Regulations 2001 w.e.f 17082001.\n2 Inserted by the SEBI Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Second Amendment Regulations 2002 w.e.f 992002.\nAdjudication in the matter of M s.\nFurther I note from the submission made on behalf of Shri Divansh Mansingka and a perusal of copy of filings under Regulation 71 of the Takeover Regulations 1997 that he had received the shares from his late father Shri Ravindra Kumar Mansingka by operation of law i.e  through transmission of shares.\nShri Divansh Mansingka has submitted a copy the death certificate of his father late Shri Ravindra Kumar Mansingka as well as a copy of his own passport showing that Shri Divansh Mansingka as the son of late Shri Ravindra Kumar Mansingka.\nFurther copies of the filings also show that the shares were received by Shri Divansh Mansingka through transmission.\nShri Divansh Mansingka had triggered the relevant provisions of Takeover Regulations 1997.\nI note from the copies of the filings submitted by Shri Divansh Mansingka that the documents submitted pertain to the filings under regulation 71 of the Takeover Regulations and No Regulation 71A thereof.\nMoreover though the receipt stamp of the company is seen on the said disclosure document there is no acknowledgment of receipt from BSE.\nFurthermore I note that Shri Divansh Mansingka has also submitted a duly acknowledged copy of the filing made to BSE under Regulation 73 of the Takeover Regulations for the relevant transaction but the said filing under Regulation 73 of the Takeover Regulations has been made by the company to BSE.\nI however find that the Companies Act distinguishes transmission of shares from transfer of shares.\nExecution of transfer deed is No required in case of transmission of shares.\nAlso I note that Shri Divansh Mansigka was a minor at the time he received the shares by transmission.\nWith respect to the acquisition by the promoter Noticees viz.\nShri Prashant Deorah Shri Anil Patodia and Ms. Poonam Patodia I note that Shri Prashant Deorah Shri Anil Patodia and Ms. Adjudication in the matter of M s.\nWW Technology Holdings Ltd Poonam Patodia had acquired 10000 shares 4.08% 7500 shares 3.06% and 7000 shares 2.86% respectively on December 27 2002 as a result of which the shareholding of the promoters rose from 46.64% to 56.64%.\nSince the cumulative holding of the promoters at that point of time was between 15% and 75% of the paidup capital of the company it fell within the ambit of Regulation 111 as it existed at the relevant point of time.\nUnder Regulation 71A of Takeover Regulations 1997 any acquirer who has acquired shares or voting rights of a company under subregulation 1 of Regulation 11 was required to disclose purchase or sale aggregating two per cent or more of the share capital of the target company to the target company and the stock exchanges where shares of the target company are listed within two days of such purchase or sale along with the aggregate shareholding after such acquisition or sale.\nLikewise I find the promoter Noticees Shri Kishorilal Patodia and Shri Abhijeet Patodia acquired 5000 shares 2.04% each on February 3 2003 due to which the shareholding of the promoters went up from 56.64% to 60.73% of the paidup capital of the company.\nThe cumulative holding of the promoters was still between 15% and 75% of the paidup capital of the company it hence fell within the ambit of Regulation 111 as it existed at the relevant point of time.\nIn both the tranches it is observed from the above that the sale was of more than 2% of the shares of the company and the cumulative holding of the promoters at that relevant point of time was between 15% and 75% of the paidup capital of the company hence disclosures ought to have been made under Regulation 71A read with 72 of Takeover Regulations 1997 within two days.\nWith regard to the aforesaid compliances the promoter Noticees viz.\nShri Prashant Deorah Shri Anil Patodia Ms. Poonam Patodia Shri Kishorilal Patodia and Shri Abhijeet Patodia in their submissions have stated that delay in filing reports under Regulation 71A was due to oversight and lack of knowledge.\nThus I note that the promoter Noticees viz.\nShri Prashant Deorah Shri Anil Patodia Ms. Poonam Patodia Shri Kishorilal Patodia and Shri Abhijeet Patodia have all admitted to the delay in complying with the provisions of Regulation 71A read with Regulation 72 of Takeover Regulations 1997 within the stipulated time for the transactions referred to above.\nThe numbers of days of noncompliance in respect of the same have been enumerated in the table at Para 4 above.\nAdjudication in the matter of M s.\nWW Technology Holdings Ltd 22.\nThe next issue for consideration is whether the promoter Noticees viz.\nI note that due to the transactions noted at para 4 above the promoter Noticees viz.\nShri Prashant Deorah Shri Anil Patodia and Ms. Poonam Patodia had acquired on December 27 2002 10000 7500 and 7000 shares respectively and Shri Kishorilal Patodia and Shri Abhijeet Patodia had acquired 5000 shares each on February 3 2003.\nAs a result of the said acquisitions the holding of the promoter group increased from 46.64% to 60.73%.\nThus the acquisitions led to an increase of the promoter holding by nearly 14% in the financial year ending on 31st March 2003.\nAs per Regulation 111 of Takeover Regulations 1997 as at the relevant point of time no acquirer who together with persons acting in concert with him held 15 per cent or more but less than 75 per cent of the shares or voting rights in a company could acquire either by himself or through or with persons acting in concert with him additional shares or voting rights entitling him to exercise more than 5 per cent of the voting rights in any financial year ending on 31st March unless such acquirer makes a public announcement to acquire shares in accordance with the Regulations.\nAs per Regulation 141 of the Takeover Regulations 1997 the open offer under Regulation 111 should be made within four working days of entering into the agreement for acquisition of such shares.\nFurther the concerned promoter Noticees have also admitted that the purpose of the aforesaid acquisitions were to acquire substantial stake and take control of the company.\nWW Technology Holdings Ltd Patodia.\nIt is pertinent to note her that the promoter Noticees viz.\nShri Kishorilal Patodia and Shri Abhijeet Patodia acquired shares in the same financial year after the open offer was triggered by the promoter Noticees viz.\nI further find that the concerned promoter Noticees have also submitted that the pricing of the open offer by the Acquirer Shri Paresh Mulji Kariya was revised from Rs 10  per equity share to Rs 26  per equity share taking into consideration  the highest negotiated price paid by the concerned promoter Noticees viz.\nHowever I note from table under para 10 that after the trigger of the open offer due to the promoter Noticees viz.\nShri Prashant Deorah Shri Anil Patodia and Ms. Poonam Patodia acquiring 10000 shares 4.08% 7500 shares 3.06% and 7000 shares 2.86% respectively on December 27 2002 the following persons entities who were

Rs 1300759 .\nIt is also pertinent to note here that the revised open offer to shareholders who had No exited the company as on November 02 2012 was made by the Acquirer Shri Paresh Mulji Kariya and No by the Noticee promoters viz.\nTitan International Inc. M s.\nThe price offered to the public shareholders of M s.\nWheels India Ltd pursuant to the open offer made on December 13 2012 had factored in the interest component payable on the offer price for the period of delay.\nSubsequent to the same I find that M s.\nThe same was settled vide Consent Order dated September 12 2013. b.\nMr Vilas Valunji  Mr Partha Debnath and  Mr Janardhan Shriniwas Purandare in the matter of M s.\nIn this case I note that the acquirer  Mr Vilas Valunji along with the Adjudication in the matter of M s.\nWW Technology Holdings Ltd persons acting in concert  Mr Partha Debnath and  Mr Janardhan Shriniwas Purandare held 14.49% of the paidup capital of M s.\nVybra Automet Ltd hereinafter referred to as VAL.\nThey entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with the promoters of VAL on April 02 2010 to acquire 13.89% of the paid up capital of VAL thereby triggering Regulation 141 of the Takeover Regulations.\nThe public announcement to acquire 20% of the voting share capital of VAL was made on May 10 2010 i.e  with a delay of 32 days and interest @ 10% p.a. was paid.\nSubsequent to the same vide Order dated June 27 2013 adjudication proceedings under Section 15 H ii of the SEBI Act for the alleged violation of Regulation 141 of the Takeover Regulations were initiated against the acquirers. c.\nMr Suresh Kumar Poddar in the matter of M s.\nMayur Uniquoters Ltd.\nIn this case I note that the public announcement dated January 23 2006 was made voluntarily by the Acquirers when they came to know that their acquisition had triggered Regulation 111 of the Takeover Regulations in the years 1997 1998 and 2002.\nInterest @ 15% p.a. on the price amounting to Rs 23.03 per share taking the first trigger date as the base was also paid.\nAdjudication proceedings were however initiated vide Order dated May 02 2006 against the acquirers under Section 15H ii of the SEBI Act for the alleged violation of Regulation 111 read with 141 of the Takeover Regulations committed by the acquirers. d.\nMr Paresh Vasani in the matter of M s.\nIn this case I note that  Mr Paresh Vasani the promoter of M s.\nCircuit Systems India Ltd was allotted 2000000 shares by way of preferential allotment on March 31 2010 due to which the shareholding of  Mr Paresh Vasani increased from 5.40% to 16.87% of the paidup capital hence by virtue of the said acquisition he had triggered Regulation 10 read with 141 of the Takeover Regulations.\nHence he was required to make public announcement No later than four working days from the date of such acquisition but he failed to do the same.\nCircuit Systems India Ltd and change in control.\nSEBI directed  Mr Paresh Vasani to revise the offer price to inter alia add 10% per annum for delay in making Adjudication in the matter of M s.\nWW Technology Holdings Ltd public announcement.\nThe offer price was accordingly revised to include the applicable interest.\nSubsequent to the same adjudication proceedings were initiated against  Mr Paresh Vasani vide Order dated May 04 2012 under Section 15 H ii of SEBI Act for the alleged violation of Regulation 10 of the Takeover Regulations committed by  Mr Paresh Vasani.\nIn view of the foregoing I am convinced that it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act on the promoter Noticees viz.\nWW Technology Holdings Ltd SEBI Act 1992 prior to SEBI Amendment Act 2002 w.e.f 29102002 Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder— b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefore in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefore in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty No exceeding five thousand rupees for every day during which the failure continues.\nSEBI Act 1992 after SEBI Amendment Act 2002 w.e.f 29102002 Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder— b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefore in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefore in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.\nShri Prashant Deorah Shri Anil Patodia Ms. Poonam Patodia Shri Kishorilal Patodia and Shri Abhijeet Patodia are liable for penalty under Section 15 Hii of the SEBI Act which reads as under “Penalty for nondisclosure of acquisition of shares and takeovers 15H.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder fails to ii make a public announcement to acquire shares at a minimum price;

a total income of Rs 132.26 million as against Rs 18.32 million in the previous year an increase by 622%.\nThe Listing Committee of BSE advised ICL to explain this phenomenal increase.\nICL failed to give any satisfactory explanation for the same to BSE.\nHence BSE shifted ICL to “Z” category with effect from February 5 2004.\nMr Akshay Pravin Sanghvi Managing Director of ICL transferred 1 crore shares offmarket to the Noticee on January 2 2004. c.\nDuring the investigation period the Noticee bought 338600 shares 3.75% of the trading volume and sold 3019944 shares 33.47% of the trading

sold the shares through PIPL. k.\nThe foregoing sequence of events leads to the finding that the Noticee manipulated the market and sold the shares of  Mr Akshay Pravin Sanghavi which it received through offmarket from him.\nRegulation 42a of PFUTP inter alia prohibits a person from indulging in an act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market.\nRegulation 42b of PFUTP inter alia prohibits dealings in a security intended to operate as a device to inflate depress or cause fluctuations in the price of such security for wrongful gains.\nRegulation 42e of PFUTP prohibits a person to act in a way to manipulate the price of the security.\nRegulation 42g of PFUTP prohibits a person from entering into a transaction in securities without intention of performing it or without intention of change of ownership of such security.\nAs detailed above the way the Noticee had traded in the scrip of ICL by increasing the price of the scrip by executing transactions No only manipulated the price of the scrip but also created artificial volume in the scrip of ICL.\nThis led to misleading appearance of trading interest in the scrip of ICL thus increasing its price.\nThis facilitated the Noticee to offload the shares which it had received offmarket from  Mr Akshay Pravin Sanghvi.\nDuring the hearing held on February 13 2009 the AR of the Noticee submitted as under  Mr Vishnu Parekh is one of the directors of the Noticee.\nHe appointed  Mr Ankur Desai as an employee to look after the business of RFPL.\nThus the aforesaid violations by the Noticee make it liable for penalty under Section 15HA of SEBI Act which read as follows “Penalty for fraudulent and unfair trade practices 15HA.\nIf any person indulges in fraudulent and unfair trade practices relating to securities he shall be liable to a penalty of twentyfive crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of such practices whichever is higher.\nNONDISCLOSURE UNDER SAST & PIT 16.\nThe Noticee had acquired 10000000 shares from  Mr Akshay Pravin Sanghvi on January 2 2004 which constituted 10.53% of the total share voting capital of ICL.\nConsequent to the said transaction the post acquisition shareholding exceeded the percentage specified in regulations 7 1 of SAST and 13 1 of PIT.\nHowever I find that no such disclosures were made.\nAfter the aforesaid acquisition the Noticee had transacted in the shares of ICL details of which are stated above.\nAs per the shareholding pattern at the quarter ended March 31 2004 I find that the shareholding of the Noticee was reduced to 6541956 shares 6.89%.\nThe change in the shareholding from 10.53% to 6.89% = 3.64% exceeded the percentage specified in regulation 13 3 of PIT.\nConsequently this change should have been disclosed under regulation 135 of PIT.\nDuring the hearing held on February 13 2009 the AR of the Noticee submitted as under  Mr Vishnu Parekh is one of the directors of the Noticee.\nHe appointed  Mr Ankur Desai as an employee to look after the business of RPL.\nThe aforesaid violations attract monetary penalty under section 15Ab of the SEBI Act which reads as under 15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made there under b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less;\nLEVY OF PENALTY 23.\nWhile determining the quantum of monetary penalty under sections 15HA and 15A b I have considered the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under “15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.”\nDue to the nondisclosure by the Noticee in the scrip of ICL genuine investors were attracted to trade in the shares of ICL.\nI find from the material available on record that the transfer of shares by  Mr Akshay Pravin Sanghavi who was the Managing Director of ICL to the Noticee through offmarket was effected on January 2 2004 which was just before the announcement of the quarterly results on January 20 2004.\nThe financial results showed that the income of the company had increased by 622% as compared to the same quarter in the previous year.\nI also find on perusal of the demat statement of the Noticee that it had sold part of the said shares received from  Mr Akshay Pravin Sanghavi in the market after the announcement of the aforesaid price sensitive information.\nThe Noticee was able to aid and abet  Mr Akshay Pravin Sanghavi to dispose of his shares by indulging in fraudulent unfair and manipulative practices as detailed in the earlier paragraphs under the head “MANIPULATIVE TRADING”.\nAfter taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case I impose a penalty of Rs 200000  Rupees Two Lakh only under section 15HA and Rs 800000  Rupees Eight Lakh only under section 15Ab of SEBI Act\nThe Noticee shall pay the said amount of penalty by way of demand draft in favour of “SEBI Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai within 45 days of receipt of this order.\nThe said demand draft shall be forwarded to Ms. Barnali Mukherjee General Manager Investigation Department  Division – ID6 Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI Bhavan Plot No.C4A “G” Block Bandra Kurla Complex Bandra East

RULES 1995 In respect of Mrs. Ratna Harish In the matter of M s.\nValecha Engineering Ltd PAN – AAAPM2475N FACTS OF THE CASE IN BRIEF 1.\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India hereinafter referred to as “SEBI” has conducted investigations into the alleged irregularities in the affairs trading and dealings in the shares of M s.\nValecha Engineering Ltd hereinafter referred to as ‘the Company VEL’ based on certain inputs received from the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd NSE regarding spurt in price of the shares of the Company dissemination of price sensitive information by the Company and trading dealings of the Company’s promoter group and its related entities in the scrip etc. During the period covered under the investigations i.e  January 01 2009 to December 31 2009 hereinafter referred to as ‘investigation period’ the shares of the Company were listed on NSE and the Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd BSE.\nThe investigations prima facie revealed that there was a delay by the Company in disseminating price sensitive information to the stock exchanges and that the promoters and the Company related entities had benefited by purchasing shares of the Company prior to dissemination of price sensitive information to public.\nFurther despite being clearly stated in its code of conduct for prevention of insider trading that trading window shall be closed 4days prior to its Board Meeting in connection with certain events it has failed to close the trading window prior to its Board Meetings which were held for the purpose of issuing of convertible warrants ADR GDR etc.\nIt was also observed that some of the Company related entities had either traded in the scrip themselves while being in possession of unpublished price sensitive information and or they communicated such unpublished price sensitive information to their family members who thereafter traded in the scrip and made unlawful gains.\nIt was alleged that  Mr Anil Harish who was the Chairman of the Company during the relevant period and his mother Mrs. Ratna Harish hereinafter referred to as “the Noticee” had traded in the shares of the Company just prior to the price sensitive corporate announcement made by VEL.\nBased on the findings of the investigations it was alleged that  Mr Anil Harish was privy to the said price sensitive information and that the Noticee who is mother of Anil Harish and is residing with him and falls under the definition of ‘insider’ under the regulation 2e r w regulation 2h of the SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 hereinafter referred to as ‘PIT Regulations’  had traded in the scrip of the Company immediately before the price sensitive information was made public by the Company and has thereby violated the provisions of the PIT Regulations.\nThe undersigned has been appointed as Adjudicating Officer under section 15 I of the SEBI Act read with rule 4 of the SEBI Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer Rules 1995 hereinafter referred to as ‘Rules’ vide order dated March 30 2011 to inquire into and adjudge under section 15HB of the SEBI Act the alleged violation of the provisions of the SEBI Act and the PIT Regulations by the Noticee.\nSHOW CAUSE NOTICE REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 5.\nShow Cause Notice No EAD1 SRP DA 15929 2011 dated May 18 2011 hereinafter referred to as ‘the SCN’ was issued to the Noticee to show cause as to why an inquiry be No initiated against her in terms of rule 4 of the Rules read with section 15 I of the SEBI Act for the alleged violation of the provisions of regulation 3 i and 3 ii of the PIT Regulations.\nThe Noticee submitted reply to the SCN vide her letter dated July 04 2011.\nConsidering the said reply of the Noticee it was decided to conduct an inquiry in the matter and for the purpose an opportunity of hearing was granted to the Noticee on August 03 2011 vide notice dated July 19 2011.\nIn reply to the said notice of hearing the Noticee vide letter dated July 30 2011 requested for an adjournment of the hearing to any date after August 20 2011.\nConsidering the said request another opportunity of hearing was granted to the Noticee on August 24 2011 which was attended by the authorized representative of the Noticee namely  Mr Vinay Chauhan Advocate.\nAt the time of the hearing the Noticee also submitted her additional written submissions dated August 24 2011 alongwith the annual report of the Company for the year 200809.\nOral submissions made by the Noticee were recorded.\nPursuant to the hearing the Noticee filed her further written submissions dated August 27 2011 and furnished details of VEL shares purchased by her and  Mr Anil Harish during August 2009 to April 2010.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 8.\nI have carefully perused the details of the allegations made against the Noticee material available on record and the oral and written submissions made by the Noticee and  Mr Anil Harish.\nThe main issue that arises here is as to whether the Noticee was in possession of any unpublished price sensitive information and before it was made public she purchased the shares of the Company and made unlawful gains.\nIf yes then whether such acts of the Noticee are in violation of the provisions of regulation 3 i of the PIT Regulations.\nIt is undisputed fact that  Mr Anil Harish son of the Noticee was the Chairman of the Company during the relevant period and had presided over the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company that was held on July 31 2009.\nIt is evident from point No 20 of the minutes of the said meeting that the matter regarding getting of projects from the Government of Arunachal Pradesh was discussed in the said meeting wherein  Mr Suresh Mansata Commercial Manager of the Company was authorized to execute and sign the Contract Agreement and bank guarantees for the said projects.\nFurther I have noted from the documents on record that the letter towards their getting of project subject to their compliance with certain conditions was issued to the Company by the Government of Arunachal Pradesh on July 31 2009.\n40 00 to 56 485 in the State of Arunachal Pradesh under SARDPNE Phase A” in the name and on behalf of the Company and to sign any related documents as may be necessary to give effect to this resolution.”\nI have perused the material on record and observed that copy of two such letters of Public Works Department of Government of Arunachal Pradesh are available which are respectively confirming about award of projects worth around 42 crore and 36 crore to the Company.\nMr Anil Harish has stated that these letters were issued on August 22 2009 and received at the Company’s end on August 24 2009.\nNow the point to be noted here is that corporate announcement regarding the aforesaid price sensitive information was made by the Company on August 28 2009 at 64845 p.m.  Mr Anil Harish son of the Noticee who was earlier No holding even a single share of the Company allegedly made the following purchases before the said corporate announcement was made by the Company on August 28 2009  Client Date Period BSE NSE Bought Sold Bought Sold Anil Harish Son of the Noticee August 21 2009 Prior to announcement August 28 2009 of getting a project worth 172 cr. 9600 0 10400 0 August 25 2009 9960 0 10040 0 13.\nThe Noticee who was also No holding even a single share earlier allegedly made the following purchases before the said corporate announcement made by the Company on August 28 2009 – Client Date Period BSE NSE Bought Sold Bought Sold Ratna Harish the Noticee August 25 2009 Prior to announcement August 28 2009 of getting a project worth 172 cr. 3701 0 5500 0 14.\nThe Noticee has further stated that before they started purchasing the shares on August 25 28 2009 in the AGM of the Company that was held on August 20 2009 the shareholders were informed that the Company had orders of about 1000 crore on hand.\nFurther I have perused the copy of corresponding speech of the Chairman made before the shareholders of the Company in the AGM on August 20 2009 and observed that there is no mention of the Arunachal Pradesh Project.\nThat means that the investors shareholders and public at large came to know about the Company bagging the project only after the corporate announcement was made by VEL in this regard on August 28 2009.\nThe Noticee has stated that if they  Mr Anil Harish and the Noticee wished to take advantage of the unpublished price sensitive information then they would have purchased the shares immediately after the Board meeting on July 31 2009 rather than to wait for three weeks until after the AGM.\nIn this regard I had advised the Noticee at the time of personal hearing to furnish all sale purchases made by her and  Mr Anil Harish during the calendar year 2009 i.e  January to December 2009.\nThe Noticee has furnished vide her letter dated August 27 2011 such details of purchases made till April 2010 which are as under – i Anil Harish the Chairman of the Company and son of the Noticee  Date of Purchase No of shares Rate per share in  21.08.2009 20000 74.38 25.08.2009 19378 88.05 28.08.2009 40000 76.00 04.01.2010 144 109.70 27.04.2010 7200 208.09 Total  86722 It is evident from the above details that  Mr Harish who was earlier No holding any shares of the Company all of a sudden started making purchases with effect from August 21 2009 and major chunk of the purchases i.e  purchase of 79 378 shares were made by him just prior to the corporate announcement made by the Company regarding its bagging of said project worth 172 crore from the Government of Arunachal Pradesh on August 28 2009 at 64845 p.m. His entire purchase of 79378 shares made in the year 2009 were just prior to the Corporate announcement made by the Company on the evening of August 28 2009.\nThereafter for the next four months he did No make any purchases.\nHer entire purchase of 19201 shares made in the year 2009 were just prior to the corporate announcement made by the Company on the evening of August 28 2009.\nIt is also evident from the above details that except for the first purchase made by  Mr Anil Harish on August 21 2009 the subsequent purchases made by him and his mother prior to the corporate announcement made by VEL are on the same dates viz.\nShe had purchased shares at an average cost of 121.83 per share and the present market price is about 97.00 per share which means that she has actually incurred loss.\nDespite that the Noticee and her son the Chairman of the Company purchased the shares before the information was disseminated to public.\nI have noted that after August 28 2009 neither of them had purchased any VEL shares for the next four months.\nThe said purchase of 79 378 shares by  Mr Anil Harish and 19201 shares by the Noticee made immediately prior to August 28 2009 are the only purchases made by them during the entire 2009.\nIn this regard I have observed that after making of public announcement there was no significant rise in the price of the shares of the Company.\nIt had moved almost in tandem with the BSE Sensex as has been detailed below  Date Closing price   Sensex 27.08.2009 84.65 15781.05 28.08.2009 Friday 93.10 15922.34 31.08.2009 Monday 91.10 15666.64 01.09.2009 86.45 15551.19 The above details suggest that after the corporate announcement was made on August 28 2009 there was subsequent fall in BSE Sensex and the price of the shares have also come down.\nThe Noticee has further purchased some shares of the Company on 04.01.2010 and thereafter on 15.04.2010 respectively @ 109.95 and 198.69 per share.\nThe Noticee has stated that the highest price of the shares in August 2009 was 93.10 and there was no impact whatsoever on prices which have remained at the same level for the last four months.\nI have noted that the price movement in the shares of the Company as has been detailed in the table at para No 20 above do indicate that during the last week of August 2009 its price had moved almost in tandem with the BSE Sensex and the corporate disclosure made by the Company on August 28 2009 regarding its getting orders worth 172 crore from the Government of Arunachal Pradesh had no significant impact on the price of the scrip.\nThe Noticee being an insider as she was mother of the Chairman of the Company and as has been discussed above was in possession of some unpublished price sensitive information and she along with her son who were earlier No holding any shares of the Company made purchases during August 21 2009 to August 28 2009 in large numbers.\nThe average price of the shares purchased by the Noticee up to August 28 2009 comes out to approximately 81.29 per share\n[i.e  9201*87.27+10000*76.00 divided by 19201 i.e  the number of shares purchased.\nAverage closing price of the shares for the week after August 28 2009 was approximately 87.20.\nIn light of the facts and circumstances of the case as discussed above I hold the Noticee guilty of violating regulation 3 i of the PIT Regulations for which there is provision for imposition of penalty under section 15 G of the SEBI Act.\nThe provisions of section 15 G of the SEBI Act are reproduced hereunder – 15G.\nPenalty for insider trading.\n– If any insider who i either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person deals in securities of a body corporate listed on any stock exchange on the basis of any unpublished price sensitive information; or ii communicates any unpublished price sensitive information to any person with or without his request for such information except as required in the ordinary course of business or under any law; or iii counsels or procures for any other person to deal in any securities of any body corporate on the basis of unpublished pricesensitive information shall be liable to a penalty of twentyfive crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of insider trading whichever is higher.\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15 G of the SEBI Act it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15 J of the SEBI Act which are as under 15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nHowever from the above estimates roughly the figures for the undue gains made by the Noticee comes out to around 1.14 lakh.\nTherefore considering all the facts and circumstances of the case I am of the opinion that a penalty of 3.40 lakh on the Noticee which is around three times the undue gains made by her shall be commensurate with the violations committed .\nIn exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15 I of the Act and rule 4 of the Rules I impose penalty of 340000  Rupees thee lakh forty thousand only on the Noticee in terms of the provisions of section 15 G of the SEBI Act for the violation of the aforesaid provisions of the PIT Regulations.\nThe Noticee shall pay the said amount of penalty by way of demand draft in favour of “SEBI  Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai within 45 days of receipt of this order.\nThe said demand draft should be forwarded to The Deputy General Manager IVD – ID4 Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI Bhavan Plot No.C4A “G” Block Bandra Kurla Complex Bandra East Mumbai–400 051.\nIn terms of the provisions of rule 6 of the Rules

granted an opportunity of personal hearing on January 20 2014 vide notice dated January 03 2014.\nMs. Shailashri Bhaskar Practicing Company Secretary appeared as Authorized Representative AR on behalf of the Noticee and reiterated the submissions made in the reply to SCN.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 7.\nI have carefully perused the oral and written submissions of the Noticee and the documents available on record.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the present case are  a.\nWhether the Noticees had violated the provisions of regulation 71A read with regulation 72 of the SAST Regulations 1997? b.\nDoes the violation if any attract monetary penalty under section 15A b of SEBI Act? c.\nIf so what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of SEBI Act?\nBefore moving forward it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of SAST Regulations 1997 which reads as under SAST Regulations 1997 “Acquisition of 5 per cent and more shares or voting rights of a company.\n7 1 .... 1A Any acquirer who has acquired shares or voting rights of a company under subregulation 1 of regulation 11 shall disclose purchase or sale aggregating two per cent or more of the share capital of the target company to the target company and the stock exchanges where shares of the target company are listed within two Adjudication Order in the matter of Blue Blends India Limited days of such purchase or sale along with the aggregate shareholding after such acquisition or sale.\nExplanation.\nFor the purposes of subregulations 1 and 1A the term acquirer shall include a pledgee other than a bank or a financial institution and such pledgee shall make disclosure to the target company and the stock exchange within two days of creation of pledge.\n2 The disclosures mentioned in subregulations 1 and 1A shall be made within two days of— a the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares; or b the acquisition of shares or voting rights as the case may be.”\nConsolidation of holdings.\n1 No acquirer who together with persons acting in concert with him has acquired in accordance with the provisions of law 15 per cent or more but less than fifty five per cent 55% of the shares or voting rights in a company shall acquire either by himself or through or with persons acting in concert with him additional shares or voting rights entitling him to exercise more than 5% of the voting rights in any financial year ending on 31st March unless such acquirer makes a public announcement to acquire shares in accordance with the regulations.\nFinding The issues for examination in this case and the findings thereon are as follows a Whether the Noticees had violated the provisions of regulation 71A read with regulation 72 of the SAST Regulations 1997?\nAs per provisions of regulation 71A of the SAST Regulations 1997 any acquirer who has acquired shares or voting rights and the acquisition is Adjudication Order in the matter of Blue Blends India Limited within the limits provided under regulation 111 of the SAST Regulations 1997 and subsequently there is change in shareholding exceeding two percent of the share capital of the target company by way of purchase or sale then in terms of the provisions of regulation 71A read with regulation 72 of the SAST Regulations 1997 the acquirer whose shareholding has so changed is under obligation to make disclosures within two days to the target company and to the stock exchange where the shares of the company are listed regarding such sale or purchase.\nUpon perusal of submissions of the Noticee and documents available on record I find that Noticee was admittedly part of the promoter group which was acting in concert in exercising control over BBIL at the relevant period and the company has been disclosing the shareholding of the Noticee under the category of promoters.\nI further find that prior to the transaction in question promoter group held 44.58% of the share capital of BBIL which was within the limits specified under regulation 111 of SAST Regulations 1997.\nNoticee as being part of the promoter group which exercised control over BBIL thus was an acquirer within regulation 2b of the SAST Regulations 1997.\nIt is also No in dispute that the Noticee had sold 489843 shares of BBIL on March 28 2006 which was 3.23% of the share capital of BBIL.\nAs the said sale transaction exceeded the benchmark limit of 2% the Noticee ought to have made a disclosure within 2 days of transaction as stipulated by regulation 71A read with regulation 72 of SAST Regulations 1997.\nIt is also an admitted fact that the Noticee has No made any disclosure under the aforementioned regulations for the transaction dated March 28 2006.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of Blue Blends India Limited 12.\nI note that even for availing the exemption from public announcements transferors and transferee are required to comply with disclosure requirement under regulations 6 7 and 8 of the SAST Regulations 1997.\nNoticee further contended that it had made the requisite disclosures as stipulated under Regulation 133 of PIT Regulations 1992 on the date of sale itself and noticee never had any intention to conceal any transaction from the investors.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of Blue Blends India Limited 14.\nThe Adjudicating Officer SEBI dated January 15 2014 wherein similar contention of information being in the public domain was raised by the appellant.\nIn view of the above and based on the available documents and records before me I find that there has been a lapse on the part of the Noticee and thus the violation of regulation 71A read with regulation 72 of SAST Regulations 1997 stands established in respect of transaction dated March 28 2006. b Does the noncompliance if any attract monetary penalty under section 15A b of SEBI Act?\nHowever in the instant matter Noticee has admittedly indulged in the transaction of sale of shares to Mrs. Indu Arya above the benchmark limit specified under regulation 71A of SAST Regulations 1997.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of Blue Blends India Limited 18.\nI have considered other contentions raised by the Noticee in their reply and find no merit in it.\nAs the violation of the statutory obligation under regulation 71A read with regulation 72 of SAST Regulations 1997 has been established I hold that the Noticees are liable for monetary penalty under section 15Ab of SEBI Act which reads as under “15A.\nPenalty for failure to furnish information return etc.  If any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made there under  a... ... ... b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less” c If so what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of SEBI Act?\nAdjudication Order in the matter of Blue Blends India Limited 20.\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under section 15A b it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under “15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.”\nFrom the material available on record the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage to the Noticee or loss caused to the investors as a result of the default is No quantifiable.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of Blue Blends India Limited ORDER 22.\nTherefore in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15I 2 of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules I hereby impose a penalty of 400000  Rupees Four Lakh only under Section 15Ab for failure to make disclosures regulation 71A read with regulation 72 of SAST Regulations 1997 on the Noticee i.e  Blue Blends Leasing Pvt Limited.\nNoticee shall pay the said amount of penalty by way of demand draft in favour of “SEBI  Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai within 45 days of receipt of this order.\nThe said demand draft should be forwarded to The Division Chief CFDDCR Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI Bhavan Plot No C– 4 A “G” Block Bandra Kurla Complex Bandra E Mumbai – 400 051.\nIn terms of rule 6 of the Rules copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.\nDate January 31 2014 A.

February 25 2004.\nThere is Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES 14.\nI have carefully perused the written submissions of the Noticee the submissions made at the hearing and the documents available on record.\nKhatau Exim Limited year FY 1997‐98 to FY 2003‐04 again once for the FY 2006 and again for 2 consecutive financial years FY 2008‐09 to FY 2009‐10.\nWhether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 83 of the Takeover Regulations for 7 consecutive financial years from financial year FY 1997‐98 to FY 2003‐04 again once for the FY 2006 and again for 2 consecutive financial years FY 2008‐09 to FY 2009‐10? b.\nDo the violations if any attract monetary penalty under Section 15 Abof SEBI Act? c.\nIf so what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act?\nBefore moving forward it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of Regulation 83 of the Takeover Regulations 1997 which reads as under Regulation 83 of the Takeover Regulations 1997 Continual disclosure.\n8 3 Every company whose shares are listed on a stock exchange shall within 30 days from the financial year ending March 31 as well as the record date of the company for the purposes of declaration of dividend make yearly disclosures to all the stock exchanges on which the shares of the company are listed the changes if any in respect of the holdings of the persons referred to under sub regulation 1 and also holdings of promoters or persons having control over the company as on 31st March.\nNo the first issue for consideration is whether the Noticee was required to make the relevant disclosure under the provisions of Regulations 83 of the Takeover Regulations 1997for 7 consecutive financial years from financial year FY 1997‐98 to FY 2003‐04 again once for the FY 2006 and again for 2 consecutive financial years FY 2008‐09 to FY 2009‐10.The SCN alleged violation non‐compliance by the Noticee in respect of Regulation 83 of Takeover Regulations 1997 as incorporated in the letter of Offer.\nThe same is as shown in the tabular form below Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nKhatau Exim Limited Regulation Due Date of compliance Date of compliance Non‐compliance Delay no. of days 83 30.04.1998 25.02.2004 2127 83 30.04.1999 25.02.2004 1762 83 30.04.2000

30.04.2010 13.05.2010 13 18.\nAs per Regulation 83 of the Takeover Regulations 1997 Noticee was required to make yearly disclosure within 30 days from the financial year ending March 31 to the stock exchanges on which the shares of the company were listed the changes if any in respect of the holdings of the persons referred to under sub regulation 1 of regulation 8 of the Takeover Regulations 1997 and also holdings of promoters or persons having control over the company as on 31st March.\nI note here that as rightly brought out by the Noticee the SCN relies upon the disclosures made in the letter of Offer dated June 29 2011.The information disclosed in the said letter of Offer has been vetted by the Manager to the Offer M s.\nThe said letter Of Offer vetted by a SEBI registered intermediary disclosed as follows “As regards the Target Company is concerned there has been a delay in filing the disclosures .... under regulation 83 for the years 1998 to 2003 2006 2009 and 2010 by the TargetCompany.\nNo record with respect to the disclosure made under regulation 83 by the Target Company for the year 2004 isavailable.\nThe status of compliance with respect to chapter II of SEBI SAST Regulations 1997 by the Target Company isgiven in Annexure B to this Letter of Offer.”\nThus on a perusal of the letter of Offer it becomes apparent that the Manager to the Offer who has vetted the disclosures made in the letter of Offer had in 2011 made a clear distinction between Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nKhatau Exim Limited records of filing under Regulation 83 of the Takeover Regulations which were not available from the delayed filing made by the company under Regulation 83.\nUnder the SEBI Merchant Banking Regulations 1992 the Manager to the Offer is responsible for verification of the contents of the Letter of Offer in respect of the Offer and the reasonableness of the views expressed therein and is required to submit to the Board at least two weeks prior to the opening of the issue for subscription a due diligence certificate.\nI note that the Manager to the Offer M s.\nAny false or untrue certification by the Manager to the Offer would mean the risk of suspension cancellation of its registration to act as a Merchant Banker.\nIn the extant matter as stated earlier the SCN has been issued based on the due diligence conducted by a SEBI registered Merchant Banker whereby it was observed that there had been a delay by the company in complying with Regulation 83 for certain financial years which has also been admitted by the company through the submissions made.\nThe exact number of days of such delay was disclosed in the letter of offer and was available in public domain.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nKhatau Exim Limited 24.\nI find that the Noticee has confirmed that delayed filing was made by it under Regulation 83 in 2004 in respect of years 1998‐2003.\nI find further that the ARs at the Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nKhatau Exim Limited hearing on behalf of the Noticee has also submitted that the Noticee had independently based on the records available with itself and with the Registrar of the Company RoC made disclosures under Regulation 83 of the Takeover Regulations 1997 as per the compliance indicated in the letter of Offer.\nIn the matter I note that the letter of Offer in 2011 had also disclosed that SEBI may initiate action inter alia against the Company at a later stage in terms of the Takeover Regulations 1997 and provisions of the SEBI Act for the said non‐compliance of Chapter II of the Takeover Regulations 1997 inter alia by the Company.\nThere are more than 5000 listed companies who were required under Takeover Regulations 1997 to make annual filing to the stock Exchanges where the company’s shares were listed in respect of the holdings of the promoters or persons having control over the company as on 31st March.\nThe extant delayed disclosure by the company under Regulation 83 came to notice of the Manger to the Offer while carrying out the due diligence with respect to the compliances made by the company under Takeover Regulations 1997 at the time of open offer by  Mr Nav Rattan Munjal ‘Acquirer’.\nThe same was accordingly disclosed in the letter of offer and to SEBI.\nSEBI thereafter initiated the extant adjudication proceedings in the matter.\nAdjudicating Officer SEBI the Honble SAT on August 31 2000 held that – Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nAs per the letter of Offer I find that no record with respect to the disclosures made under regulation 83 by the company for the year 2004 is available.\nIn absence of evidence as to whether the Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nI find that the Noticee in its submission has admitted that the filings relating to regulation 83 of Takeover Regulations 1997 during the period of the financial years ending March 1998‐2003 had once been filed on February 25 2004.\nI find that Regulation 83 is in the form of mandatory annual disclosures to be filed by a company to the stock exchanges on which the shares of the company are listed in respect of the shareholding inter alia of the promoters or personss having control over the company so that investors are made aware of the changes if any in the holdings of these persons so as to enable them to take an informed investment decision.\nThe respective number of days of delay in compliance under Regulation 83 for each applicable financial year has been enumerated in the table at Para 17 above.\nSEBI Appeal No. 177 of 2009 and Order dated April 08 2010 the Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nIn view of the foregoing I am convinced that it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act for the violation of Regulation 83 of the Takeover Regulation as applicable against the Noticee which reads as under 15 Ab of the SEBI Act 1992 prior to SEBI Amendment Act 2002 w.e.f 29‐10‐2002 If any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder‐‐ To file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding five thousand rupees for every day during which such failure continues.\n15 Ab of the SEBI Act 1992 after SEBI Amendment Act 2002 w.e.f 29‐10‐2002 Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc.‐ 15.AbIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder‐‐ To file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.\nWhile determining the quantum of monetary penalty under Section 15 Ab of SEBI Act I have considered the factors stipulated in Section 15‐J of SEBI Act which reads as under‐ Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer 15J.\nWhile adjudging quantum of penalty under Section 15‐I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely‐ a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nKhatau Exim Limited 36.\nIn view of the charges as established the facts and circumstances of the case and the judgments referred to and mentioned hereinabove the quantum of penalty would depend on the factors referred in Section 15‐J of SEBI Act and stated as above.\nAs per Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act prior to amendment dated October 29 2002 the Noticee was liable to a penalty No exceeding Rs 5000 ‐ for every day of default during which such default continues for failure to file any return or furnish information books or documents within the time specified.\nWith effect from October 29 2002 the Noticee is liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.\nI note that the ARs have confirmed that there was no past non‐compliance of SEBI Act and Regulations by the Noticee and no action was taken by SEBI in the past against the Noticee.\nI however note that the Honble Securities Appellate Tribumal SAT in the matter of Komal Nahata Vs.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nKhatau Exim Limited 39.\nIn the matter I also note that in Appeal No.\nIn addition to the aforesaid I am also inclined to consider the following mitigating factors while adjudging the quantum of penalty a the paid‐up capital market capitalization of the company at the relevant point of time; b the trading volumes of the company’s shares on BSE where the shares were listed during the relevant period; and c the number of occasions in the instant proceeding that the Noticee has violated the relevant provisions of the Takeover Regulations 1997.\nFrom the shareholding pattern for the quarter ended March 31 2001 to March 31 2010 as available on BSE website I note that the paid up capital of the company was Rs 2490000 comprising of 249000 equity shares of Rs 10 ‐ each of which the promoters held 248875 shares representing 99.95% of the paid‐up capital in March 2001 which gradually reduced to 185375 shares representing 74.45% in the quarter ending June 2008 and continued as such till 2010.\nFurther during the relevant period there were 127 public shareholders.\nFrom a perusal of the letter of Offer I find that the shares of the company were deemed to be infrequently traded under the Takeover Regulations 1997.\nI further note that the Noticee has submitted that the shareholding of the Noticee with respect to the period in question was available on record in view of the disclosure made by the company with BSE under clause 35 of the Listing Agreement.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nKhatau Exim Limited 43.\nFurther every company whose shares were listed on a stock Exchange was subject to disclosure requirements under Regulation 83 of the Takeover Regulations 1997 irrespective of reporting made under clause 35 of the listing agreements with the stock Exchanges.\nAs a listed company the Noticee had a responsibility to comply with the disclosure requirements in accordance with their spirit intention and purposeso that the investors could take a decision whether to buy sell or hold the Noticee’s securities.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nKhatau Exim Limited ORDER 47.\nAfter taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case I impose a penalty of Rs 450000 ‐Rupees Four lakh fifty thousand only on the Noticee viz.\nKhatau Exim Limited now known as M s.\nVelox Industries Limited under the provisions of Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act for violation of

IMPOSING PENALTIES BY ADJUDICATING OFFICER RULES 1995 In respect of Narois Impex Private Limited PAN AADCN1076D In the matter of Mahan Industries Limited BACKGROUND IN BRIEF 1.\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India SEBI conducted investigation into the irregular transactions in the shares of Mahan Industries Limited hereinafter referred to as MIL company.\nAs on December 31 2009 MIL had issued & paidup capital of 7150000 shares of 10  each.\nOn January 4 2010 MIL made a preferential allotment of convertible equity warrants for 30 crores.\nOn January 15 2010 MIL split its one share of 10  each into 10 equity shares of 1  each and as a result company had issued & paidup capital of 71500000  divided into 71500000 shares of 1  each and outstanding convertible equity warrants of 30 crores.\nOn February 20 2010 the Board of Directors of MIL decided that convertible warrants where full amount of consideration was received by the company shall be converted into equal number of shares of 1  each.\nAccordingly on February 20 2010 MIL made allotment of 248500000 shares of 1  each to the preferential allottees of the convertible equity warrants.\nTherefore on February 20 2010 MIL Adjudication Order against Narois Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd had issued & paidup capital of 320000000 shares of 1  each and outstanding convertible preferential warrants worth 51500000  2.\nThe details of the shares acquired by Narois Impex Private Limited hereinafter referred to as Noticee pursuant to conversion of equity warrants into equity share of 1  each by MIL on February 20 2010 and its percentage to the issued capital of MIL as on that date was as under Name No of shares allotted % of shares to the issued capital of the company 320000000 shares of 1  each Narois Impex Pvt Ltd 16675000 5.21 3.\nSince the acquisition of shares by the noticee on February 20 2010 entitled them to more than the threshold limits 5% of shares or voting rights of MIL as stipulated under regulations 71 and 71A read with regulation 72 of SEBI Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations 1997 hereinafter referred to as SAST Regulations 1997 Noticee was under obligation to make disclosure about its aggregate shareholding or voting rights in the MIL to MIL as well as to BSE within 2 days of transaction.\nSince no such disclosures as stipulated by the afore mentioned regulations for the said transaction dated February 20 2010 was made by the Noticee it was alleged that the Noticee violated the provisions of regulations 71 and 71A read with regulation 72 of SAST Regulations 1997.\nFurther since pursuant to conversion of equity warrants into equity share of 1  each by MIL on February 20 2010 noticee held 5% or more shares of MIL Noticee was also under an obligation to make disclosure about their shareholding or voting rights in the MIL to MIL in Form A within 2 days of the transaction as stipulated by Regulation 131 of SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 PIT Regulations Adjudication Order against Narois Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd 1992.\nSince no such disclosure was made by the Noticee it was alleged that the Noticee violated the provisions of regulation 131 of PIT Regulations 1992.\nDuring the course of investigation Noticee was issued i. summons No WRO NP CF MIL 0349 2013 dated February 22 2013 under section 11C3 of the SEBI Act to furnish certain information as mentioned in the Annexure to the summons before the Investigation Authority IA and ii. summons No WRO NP CF MIL 0591 2013 dated March 08 2013 under section 11C5 of the SEBI Act to appear in person before the IA on March 20 2013 to answer questions in relation to the investigation.\nIt was alleged that the noticee did No furnish complete information as required under the summons dated February 22 2013 No did it appear on the scheduled date and time before the IA as required under the summons dated March 08 2013 in violation of the provisions of section 11C3 and 11C5 of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992 hereinafter referred to as “SEBI Act 1992”.\nShri A. Sunil Kumar was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer to inquire and adjudge under section 15Aa and 15Ab of the SEBI Act 1992 the alleged violations of provisions of regulations 71 and 71A read with regulation 72 of SAST Regulations 1997; read with Regulation 35 of SEBI Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations 2011 SAST Regulations 2011 Regulation 131 of PIT Regulations 1992 and Section 11C3 and 11C5 of the SEBI Act 1992 Adjudication Order against Narois Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd by the noticee.\nSubsequent to the transfer of Shri A. Sunil Kumar the undersigned is appointed as Adjudicating Officer in the present matter vide order dated June 22 2015.\nSHOW CAUSE NOTICE REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 8.\nShow Cause Notice No EAD5 ADJ ASK AA OW 28878 2014 dated October 01 2014 hereinafter referred to as “SCN” was issued to the noticee in terms of Rule 4 of SEBI Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer Rules 1995 hereinafter referred to as the ‘Adjudication Rules’ read with section 15I of SEBI Act 1992 to show cause as to why an inquiry should No be initiated and penalty be No imposed under section 15Aa and 15Ab of SEBI Act 1992 for the alleged violations specified in the SCN.\nCopies of the documents relied upon in the SCN were also provided to the Noticee along with the SCN.\nThe SCN was duly delivered to the noticee but no reply to the SCN was submitted by the noticee.\nThereafter Noticee was given opportunities of personal hearing on December 19 2014 January 16 2015 and January 28 2015.\nFinally the Noticee attended the personal hearing on January 28 2015 through Ms. Rinku S Valanju Advocate.\nDuring the course of hearing she submitted a copy of the noticee’s reply dated January 27 2015 in response to SCN and reiterated the same.\nIt was also submitted that the noticee is contemplating the option of filing consent application in the matter for settlement of the adjudication proceedings and sought time of 10 days for filing the same.\nThe summary of submissions of the noticee with respect to specific charges alleged in the SCN are as follows Adjudication Order against Narois Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd  There is considerable delay of about 4 years in issuing the SCN as the conversion of the impugned convertible warrants pertain to February 2010 and SCN is issued in October 2014.\nThe said warrants got converted into 16675000 equity shares on 22.02.2010 constituting 5.21% of the issued capital of the company at the relevant time.\nAs per company’s notice dated 05.11.2009 to the shareholders our post preferential issue shareholding was to become 4.49% of total equity capital.\nHowever it appears that instead of complete conversion of 3 crore warrants Rs 30 crores the conversion of 248500000 warrants Rs 24.85 crores took place in February 2010 and hence noticee’s holding became 5.21% instead of 4.49% as planned earlier.\nFurther the remaining 51500000 warrants got converted into equity shares in May 2010 and accordingly the noticee’s holding got reduced to 4.49% as mentioned in the notice dated 05.11.2009.\nHence our shareholding crossed 5% only for a brief period of 2 months and the disclosure for the same has been made to BSE on January 24 2015.\nHowever the company had made this disclosure to BSE in its quarterly disclosure for the quarter ended March 2010.\nAdjudication Order against Narois Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd 11.\nAs per the records the consent application filed by the noticee was rejected by SEBI.\nThe undersigned after being appointed as Adjudicating Officer in the present matter also gave opportunities of hearing to the Noticee on July 21 2015 and August 11 2015.\nThe hearing scheduled on August 11 2015 was attended by the ARs who reiterated the submissions made vide letter dated January 27 2015.\nIt was also admitted that summons dated February 22 2013 were received by them and that they had submitted partial information vide letter dated March 02 2013.\nHowever as regards the summons dated March 08 2013 for personal appearance the ARs requested for inspection of acknowledgement of the said summons.\nARs also requested one week time for filing additional submissions from the date of completion of inspection.\nVide letter dated August 31 2015 noticee made the additional submissions as regards the charges in the SCN.\nVide letter dated November 30 2015 opportunity of inspection of acknowledgement of summons dated

issued by SEBI was also provided.\nNo further submissions post the inspection was made by the noticee.\nAnother opportunity of hearing post inspection of documents was granted to the Noticee on January 07 2016 which was attended by their advocate Ms. Rinku Valanju.\nAs regards the violation of section 11C5 of SEBI Act 1992 it was acknowledged by the counsel that the said summons were served on the noticee.\nVide letter dated August 09 2016 Noticee forwarded a copy of the order dated July 14 2016 of Honble Securities Appellate Tribunal SAT in the matter of Concord Realty Private Limited vs  SEBI Appeal No 22 of 2016 having identical facts same cause of action in the same scrip Adjudication Order against Narois Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd wherein Hon’ble SAT had held qua the appellant therein that “....failure to make disclosure during the period from February 20 2010 till May 2010 cannot be attributed to the appellant and therefore the appellant cannot be held guilty of violating the 1997 Regulations and PIT Regulations.\nConsidering that more than three months had lapsed since the conclusion of the hearing Noticee was given opportunity of making additional written submissions if any vide letter dated April 11 2017.\nVide letter dated May 18 2017 additional submissions were made by the noticee wherein they relied on the order dated July 14 2016 of the Hon’ble SAT in the matter of Concord Realty Private Limited vs  SEBI Appeal No 22 of 2016 which had arisen out of the same set of facts in the same scrip as the matter in hand.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 17.\nI have carefully perused the submissions of the Noticee and the documents available on record.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the present case are  a.\nWhether Noticee violated the provisions of regulations 71 and 71A read with regulation 72 of SAST Regulations 1997 and regulation 131 of PIT Regulations 1992? b.\nWhether Noticee violated the provisions of section 11C3 and 11C5 of SEBI Act 1992? c.\nDoes the violation if any attract monetary penalty under section 15Aa and 15Ab of SEBI Act 1992?\nAdjudication Order against Narois Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd Issue I  Violation the provisions of regulations 71 and 71A read with regulation 72 of SAST Regulations 1997 and regulation 131 of PIT Regulations 1992?\nRelevant provisions of SAST Regulations 1997 and PIT Regulations 1992 are as under SAST Regulations 1997 “Acquisition of 5 per cent and more shares or voting rights of a company.\n7 1 Any acquirer who acquires shares or voting rights which taken together with shares or voting rights if any held by him would entitle him to more than five per cent or ten per cent or fourteen per cent or fifty four per cent or seventy four per cent shares or voting rights in a company in any manner whatsoever shall disclose at every stage the aggregate of his shareholding or voting rights in that company to the company and to the stock exchanges where shares of the target company are listed.\n1A Any acquirer who has acquired shares or voting rights of a company under subregulation 1 of regulation 11 or under second proviso to sub regulation 2 of regulation 11 shall disclose purchase or sale aggregating two per cent or more of the share capital of the target company to the target company and the stock exchanges where shares of the target company are listed within two days of such purchase or sale along with the aggregate shareholding after such acquisition or sale.\nFor the purposes of subregulations 1 and 1A the term acquirer shall include a pledgee other than a bank or a financial institution and such pledgee shall make disclosure to the target company and the stock exchange within two days of creation of pledge.\n2 The disclosures mentioned in subregulations 1 and 1A shall be made within two days of— a the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares; or b the acquisition of shares or voting rights as the case may be.”\nPIT Regulations 1992 Disclosure of interest or holding by directors and officers and substantial shareholders in a listed companies  Initial Disclosure 13.\n1 Any person who holds more than 5% shares or voting rights in any listed company shall Adjudication Order against Narois Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd disclose to the company in Form A the number of shares or voting rights held by such person on becoming such holder within 2 working days of — a the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares; or b the acquisition of shares or voting rights as the case may be.\nThe disclosure for the said acquisition was admittedly made by the noticee on January 27 2015 post receipt of SCN.\nIt is the case of the Noticee that had the company converted all the 3 crore warrants Rs 30 crores into equity shares as originally planned its shareholding would have been 4.49% only which is less than 5%.\nBut without notice to the Noticee the company converted 248500000 warrants Rs 24.85 crores instead of 3 crore warrants into equity shares in February 2010 which led to the shareholding of the Noticee to be 5.21% as against 4.49% as originally planned.\nFurther the remaining 51500000 warrants got converted into equity shares in May 2010 and accordingly the noticee’s holding got reduced to 4.49% as mentioned in the notice dated 05.11.2009.\nHence the shareholding of Noticee crossed 5% only for a period of 2 months.\nCounsel for the Noticee has heavily relied on the order dated July 14 2016 of the Hon’ble SAT in the matter of Concord Realty Private Limited Adjudication Order against Narois Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd vs  SEBI Appeal No 22 of 2016 which had arisen out of the same set of facts in the same scrip as the matter in hand wherein it was held as follows “6.\nAdjudication Order against Narois Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd 22.\nHad the company converted 3 crore warrants the acquisition of the noticee would have been 4.49% but as the company had converted 248500000 warrants on February 20 2010 the acquisition of noticee was 5.21%.\nI note that the said provision is applicable only in respect of those acquirers whose shareholding together with shareholding of persons acting in concert fall under Regulation 111 of SAST Regulations 1997 i.e between 15% and 55% or under second proviso to Regulation 112 of SAST Regulations 1997 i.e between 55% and 75%.\nIn the instant matter I find that the shareholding of the noticee post conversion of warrants into equity shares was 5.33% which is below the limits prescribed under regulation 111 or under second proviso to Regulation 112 of SAST Regulations 1997.\nAdjudication Order against Narois Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd Issue II Whether Noticee violated the provisions of section 11C3 and 11C5 of SEBI Act 1992 24.\nIt would be appropriate here to refer to the aforesaid provisions of the SEBI Act 1992 which reads as under Section 11C3 and Section 11C5 of the SEBI Act 1992 Section 11C3 The Investigating Authority may require any intermediary or any person associated with securities market in any manner to furnish such information to or produce such books or registers or other documents or record before him or any person authorised by it in this behalf as it may consider necessary if the furnishing of such information or the production of such books or registers or other documents or record is relevant or necessary for the purposes of its investigation.\nSection 11C5 Any person directed to make an investigation under sub section 1 may examine on oath any manager managing director officer and other employee of any intermediary or any person associated with securities market in any manner in relation to the affairs of his business and may administer an oath accordingly and for that purpose may require any of those persons to appear before it personally.\nIt is No in dispute that the Noticee was issued summons dated February 22 2013 under section 11C3 of the SEBI Act to furnish certain information as mentioned in the Annexure to the summons before the Investigation Authority on March 04 2013.\nIt is also an admitted fact that the said summons was received by the Noticee and vide letter dated March 03 2013 noticee submitted only part of the information as required by the said summons.\nIt was further stated that other details sought vide the said summons would be submitted in due course of time.\nIt is also a matter of record that the Noticee was issued another summon dated March 08 2013 under section 11C5 of the SEBI Act to appear in person through its Managing Director before the Investigation Adjudication Order against Narois Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd Authority on March 20 2013 to answer questions in relation to the investigation which the noticee failed to do despite the said summons being duly received by them.\nHad the Noticee made appearance before the investigating officer and answered his queries or if they had furnished the requisite information that was sought from them that would have helped the investigation.\nI note that in their reply dated January 27 2015 Noticee has submitted for the first time the documents information including details relating to demat account statement and bank book and cash book sought by the summons dated February 22 2013 after a lapse of more than 2 years.\nAdjudication Order against Narois Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd 30.\nIssue III  Does the violation if any attract monetary penalty under section 15Aa and 15A b of SEBI Act 1992?\nSince only the allegation of violation of Section 11C3 and 11C5 of SEBI Act 1992 by the Noticee is established for the aforesaid reasons the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under section 15Aa of SEBI Act 1992 which at the time of violation read as under Adjudication Order against Narois Impex Pvt Ltd in the matter of Mahan Industries Ltd 15A.\nPenalty for failure to furnish information return etc.  If any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder a to furnish any document return or report to the Board fails to furnish the same he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less;”\nI have considered the factors mentioned in section 15J of SEBI Act 1992 and I note that the material made available on record has No quantified the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticee and the loss suffered by the investors as a result of the Noticees default.\nHowever by No submitting complete details in response to summons including those relating to Bank and demat statements which could have shown the fund flow and securities flow and by No appearing before the IA through its Managing Director as summoned for answering queries giving explanations clarifications despite having received the summons hampers the investigation.\nNoticee has submitted that there is delay of about 4 years in issue of the SCN which is in gross violation of principles of natural justice.\nAfter taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case I in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15I 2 of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules hereby impose following penalty on the noticee i.e  Narois Impex Private Limited  Adjudication Order against

reply to the SCN but also failed to appear for the hearing on the stipulated date.\nTherefore I am compelled to proceed with the matter exparte on the basis of facts material on record.\nCONSIDERATION

‘Parshwa’ and Softeng Computers Pvt Ltd hereinafter termed as ‘Softeng’.\nThe merger was as per the scheme of arrangement u s 391 to 394 of the Companies Act 1956 and approved by the Hon’ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh.\nAs a result of the merger there was allotment of shares of the Company that were made to the existing shareholders of Parshwa.\nThe share capital of the Company increased from 20774601 shares to 74514928 shares.\nIn terms of the Hon’ble High Court Order 53740328 shares were allotted to the share holders of Parshwa by the Company.\nThe Noticee was allotted 5846000 shares of the Company on 20th June 2012.\nPursuant to the above said allotment of shares certain persons entities including the Noticee were also appearing in the promoter group of NITSL.\nThe

the SAST Regulations and PIT Regulations are triggered when an entity’s shareholding in a company crosses the threshold limit of 5% of the total share capital of the company.\nIn the instant matter I observe from the material on record and also from the data mentioned in the above table that the Noticee was No holding any share of NITSL as on June 19 2012 I find that pursuant to the scheme of arrangement as discussed above the Noticee received 5846000 shares of the Company on June 20 2012.\nThe above transaction resulted in Noticee’s shareholding in the Company going up to 7.85% of the total share capital of NITSL as on June 20 2012.\nThe said transaction also resulted in the Noticee’s shareholding in NITSL crossing the threshold limit of 5% of the total share capital of the Company as on June 20 2012.\nTherefore the Noticee was required to make the necessary disclosures to the Company and to BSE in the prescribed format within two working days of her acquisition of shares in terms of Regulation 291 read with Regulation 293 of the SAST Regulations.\nFurther the Noticee was also required to make the disclosures in the prescribed format Form A to the Company within two working days of her acquisition of shares in terms of Regulation 131 of the PIT Regulations.\nI observe from the website of BSE that the relevant disclosures under Regulation 29 1 read with Regulation 29 3 of the SAST Regulations were made by the Noticee on February 22 2013 also evident from the disclosure format made by the Noticee observed from BSE website.\nI further observe from the records material made available that the Noticee had No made the relevant disclosure to the Company under the provisions of Regulation 131 of the PIT Regulations.\nPursuant to the allotment of shares of the Company to the shareholders of Parshwa in terms of the Scheme of arrangement certain allottees including the Noticee have been included in the category of promoter promoter group of the Company.\nTherefore the Noticee who was allotted 5846000 shares of the Company on June 20 2012 was required to make the disclosure in the prescribed format Form B to the Company in terms of Regulation 13 2A of the PIT Regulations within two working days of becoming a promoter or person belonging to the promoter group of the Company.\nIt is further noted from the above Table that the transactions of the Noticee in NITSL during the relevant period has resulted in change in the Noticee’s shareholding or voting rights and the change has exceeded Rs 5 lakhs in value or 25000 shares in terms of quantity of shares traded or 1 % of the total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower.\nThe Noticee who was the promoter of NITSL during the relevant period of the transactions was required to make the necessary disclosures w.r.t. change in her shareholding to the Company and to the Stock Exchanges in the prescribed reporting format Form D in terms of Regulation 13 4A read with Regulation 13 5 of the PIT Regulations.\nThe said disclosures were to be made by the Noticee within two working days of the acquisition or sale of shares as the case may be.\nSpecifically I observe from the transactions of the Noticee in the scrip of NITSL as mentioned in the Table above that the Noticee had bought sold shares of NITSL on July 06 and 24 2012 August 14 17 24 27 28 29 30 August 2012 and on September 07 13 and September 28 2012.\nI observe that the quantity of the shares traded on these dates by the Noticee were in excess of 25000 shares.\nTherefore the Noticee who was part of the promoter promoter group of the Company was required to make the necessary disclosures under Regulation 13 4A of the PIT Regulations for the aforementioned transactions.\nFurther I also note from the transactions mentioned in the Table above that on August 14 2012 Noticee had sold 2500000 shares of NITSL which resulted in change in her shareholding and the change exceeding more than 2% of the total shareholding in the Company.\nIn terms of the provisions of Regulation 29 2 of the SAST Regulations and Regulation 133 of the PIT Regulations the Noticee was required to disclose such change in her shareholding to the Company within two working days of her sale of such shares which had exceeded the threshold limit.\nHowever I observe that the Noticee had made these disclosures to the BSE only on February 22 2013 2013 i.e with a delay of more than 6 months.\nTherefore irrespective of the fact as to whether the shares were purchased from open market or shares were received on account of amalgamation or by way of bonus shares if as a result of such acquisition receipt percentage of shares held by that person exceeds the limits prescribed under the respective regulations then it is mandatory to make disclosures under those regulations.”\nTherefore I am of the view that Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under the provisions of Section 15 A b of the SEBI Act.\nIn view of the violation of the provisions of law by the Noticee as established above the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under the provisions of Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act which reads as under  Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made there under bTo file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefore in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefore in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.\nIn this regard the provisions of Section 15J of the SEBI Act and Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules require that while adjudging the quantum of penalty the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely;  a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nHaving considered all the facts and circumstances of the case the material available on record the factors mentioned in the preceding paragraphs including the judgment of Hon’ble SAT in the matter of Vitro Commodities

1.\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India SEBI conducted investigation in the scrip of Multi Commodity Exchange of India Limited hereinafter referred to as “Company MCX” for the period of April 27 2012 to July 31 2013.\nIt was observed in investigation that National Spot Exchange Limited NSEL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Financial Technologies India Ltd “FTIL” which also holds 26% of the shareholding in MCX.\nFurther all three companies i.e  NSEL FTIL and MCX are under a common management with common directors and employees.\nA Show Cause Notice dated April 27 2012 was issued by the Department of Consumer Affairs DCA SCN to NSEL.\nAs per the Investigating Authority the Unpublished Price Sensitive Information “UPSI” in respect of the shares of MCX was the implication of the DCA SCN dated April 27 2012 issued to NSEL i.e  suspension of short selling by its Members pairing of contracts and settlement of contracts beyond 11 Adjudication Order in respect of Joseph Massey in the matter of MCX days impending payment defaults by the members of NSEL and loss of reputation of Promoters and Management of MCX.\nIt was observed that any news impacting business of NSEL will automatically impact share price of its holding company i.e  FTIL and associate companies i.e  MCX and any news impacting credentials of Promoters and Management of FTIL NSEL and MCX will also impact the share price of MCX therefore suspension of trading by NSEL was a negative news.\nAs per the Investigating Authority the UPSI came into existence on April 27 2012 upon the issuance of the SCN to NSEL by the DCA and it ceased to exist when NSEL suspended trading in all contracts except eseries contracts and deferred settlement of all pending contracts on July 31 2013.\nWhen DCA issued SCN dated April 27 2012 to NSEL Noticee was holding position of NonExecutive director in NSEL and he continued to be director in NSEL till October 21 2013 i.e  after the announcement of suspension of trading by NSEL on July 31 2013 and being a director he was well aware of all the developments in NSEL right from issuance of SCN by DCA to NSEL till suspension of trading by NSEL and thus an insider under SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 hereinafter referred to as PIT Regulations 1992.\nIt was alleged that the Noticee being an insider before the outbreak of NSEL irregularities avoided losses by selling 11240 shares of MCX between May 04 2012 to June 28 2013 when in possession of UPSI and thereby violated provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992 Adjudication Order in respect of Joseph Massey in the matter of MCX read with Regulation 122 of SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 2015 hereinafter referred to as “PIT Regulations 2015”.\nInvestigation also revealed that Noticee sold shares of FTIL during the Investigation period resulting into change in his shareholding which exceeded 5 lakh in value on six days i.e  May 04 2012 June 01 2012 November 06 2012 November 07 2012 February 25 2013 and June 28 2013 but he failed to make timely disclosures under Regulation 134 of PIT Regulations on two instances i.e  May 04 2012 and February 25 2013.\nIt was therefore alleged that Noticee failed to make requisite disclosures to the company and the stock exchange within 2 working days of change in his holdings in MCX exceeding 5 lakh in value and thereby violated Regulation 134 read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992.\nThe undersigned was appointed as Adjudicating Officer under section 15I of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992 hereinafter referred to as “SEBI Act” read with rule 3 of SEBI Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalty by Adjudicating Officer Rules 1995 hereinafter referred to as the ‘Adjudication

hereinafter referred to as “SCN” was issued to the Adjudication Order in respect of Joseph Massey in the matter of MCX Noticee under Rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should No be initiated and penalty be No imposed under section 15G and 15Ab of the SEBI Act 1992 for the alleged violations of i Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992 and ii Regulation 134 read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992.\nIn the year 2012 MCX came out with Initial Public Offer IPO for issuance of 6427378 shares at a price of Rs 1032  per share including premium.\nSince I wanted to sell the shares I had informed the company regarding my intention to do so.\nAccordingly MCX had in its Prospectus dated February 28 2012 inter alia disclosed as follows Except for Joseph Massey Sumesh Parasrampuria and Dipak Shah who intends to sell 10000 6250 and 2000 Equity hares respectively all other directors and the key management personnel of the Adjudication Order in respect of Joseph Massey in the matter of MCX Company who have been .granted options and Equity Shares on the exercise of the options have confirmed to us that they do No intend to sell any shares arising from such options within three months after the date of listing of the Equity Shares in this Offer.\nOther employees of the Company holding Equity Shares at the time of listing of Equity Shares and Equity Shares on exercise of vested options may sell their equity shareholding within the 3 month period after the listing of the Equity Shares.\nIt may be noted that post filing of reply written submission and grant of personal hearing the Whole Time Member.\nI note that in the SCN dated December 14 2017 there are following two charges that have been alleged against the Noticee i.\nViolation of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992 punishable under section 15G of SEBI Act and Adjudication Order in respect of Joseph Massey in the matter of MCX ii.\nViolation of Regulation 134 read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992 punishable under section 15Ab of SEBI Act.\nIt is clarified that the allegation of violation of Regulation 134 read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992 by the Noticee in the SCN dated December 14 2017 shall be dealt with separately after hearing the Noticee.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 11.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the present case as regards the first charge in the SCN are  I. Whether Noticee avoided losses by selling 11240 shares of MCX between May 04 2012 to June 28 2013 when in possession of UPSI and thereby violated provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992? and II.\nDoes the violation if any attract monetary penalty under section 15G of SEBI Act?\nBefore moving forward it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provision of PIT Regulations 1992 which reads as under “Prohibition on dealing communicating or counselling on matters relating to insider trading.\nNo insider shall— Adjudication Order in respect of Joseph Massey in the matter of MCX i either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person deal in securities of a company listed on any stock exchange when in possession of any unpublished price sensitive information; or” 13.\nI have perused the written submissions of the Noticee documents available on record and the WTM order dated January 05 2018 in the same matter in different proceedings.\nHaving considered the same I record my findings hereunder.\nFurther the transactions in question i.e  sale of 11240 shares of MCX between May 04 2012 to June 28 2013 as specified in the SCN have also No been disputed.\nNoticee has brought to my attention the fact that WTM of SEBI vide Order dated January 05 2018 WTM order in a separate proceedings against the noticee under sections 111 114b and 11B of SEBI Act on the same set of facts and allegations had exonerated him of the charges leveled against him.\nI note that in the said WTM order there was a specific finding with regard to the periodicity of the UPSI which is as under “25.\nHaving answered the first issue in the affirmative the next issue for consideration is whether the “price sensitive information” was unpublished during the period of investigation.\nIn this regard it is noted that on October 3 2012 an article appeared in the Economic Times a widely distributed financial newspaper which contained information relating to the issuance of SCN dated April 27 2012 to NSEL majority of the contents of the SCN allegations against NSEL with regard to violation of conditions of DCA notification dated June 5 2007 and the gist Adjudication Order in respect of Joseph Massey in the matter of MCX of NSEL’s reply to the SCN.\nThe article also covered the possible action that could be taken by DCA against NSEL i.e  withdrawal of exemption granted to NSEL vide the notification dated June 5 2007.\nIt was also alleged that NSEL did No have a stock check facility for validating a members position.\nThe article categorically mentioned that failure on part of NSEL to provide a satisfactory explanation to the allegations levelled in the SCN would result in withdrawal of exemption granted to NSEL vide notification dated June 5 2007.\nI note that in the said order WTM after deciding the period of UPSI as April 27 2012 to October 3 2012 inter alia observed that the Noticee was an insider and the following two trades of the Noticee was during the UPSI period Date No of shares sold Amount in ₹ 04.05.2012 NSE 1000 1020000 01.06.2012 NSE 5000 4781121 TOTAL 6000 5801121 17.\nWTM further held as under as regards the trades of the Noticee “40.\nConsequently it becomes necessary to examine whether Shri Joseph Massey has been able to rebut the said presumption in the facts and circumstances of the case.\nIn 2012 when MCX came out with IPO it was specifically disclosed upfront in the Prospectus dated February 28 2012 that he would be selling 10000 shares post IPO within 3 months of the IPO.\nPursuant to the said disclosure he sold a total of 6000 shares within three months of the IPO.\nSubsequently he sold 5240 shares of MCX after October 3 2012 when the alleged UPSI had become published.\nFrom the above submissions of Shri Joseph Massey it appears that the sale of 6000 shares by Shri Joseph Massey was predetermined and a disclosure in that regard was also made in the prospectus of MCX dated February 28 2012.\nThe SCN by DCA to NSEL was issued on April 27 2012 and thus it was an event subsequent to the disclosure of intention by Shri Joseph Massey to sell the shares of MCX.\nIt is clarified that the second allegation of violation of Regulation 134 read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992 by the Noticee in the SCN dated December 14 2017 shall be dealt with separately after hearing the Noticee.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Joseph Massey in the matter of MCX 31.\nIn terms of rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules copies of this order are sent to Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.\nDate February 01 2018 Prasanta Mahapatra Place Mumbai Adjudicating Officer","Violation of Regulation 134 read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992 punishable under section 15Ab of SEBI Act.", "The undersigned was appointed as Adjudicating Officer under section 15I of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992 hereinafter referred to as “SEBI Act” read with rule 3 of SEBI Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalty by Adjudicating Officer Rules 1995 hereinafter referred to as the ‘Adjudication Rules’ to inquire into and adjudge under section 15G and 15Ab of the SEBI Act the alleged violations of provisions of Regulation 3i and Regulation 134 read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992 of read with Regulation 122 of PIT Regulations 2015 by the Noticee."))

No trigger disclosure requirements under the PIT Regulations and hence no disclosure was made by the Company in this regard.\nThe aforesaid reply of the Company was No found tenable as the value of

Company on a particular date falling during the investigation period provided in the SCN were above 25000 shares. b.\nThe number of shares held by the Noticee was being reported correctly by the

Order in respect of in respect of Informed Technologies India Limited in the matter of Nagpur Power & Industries Limited. e.\nThe number of shares held by the Noticee has been always reported correctly by the Company in its shareholding pattern on quarterly basis.\nTherefore the Noticee regarded the shares disclosed by the Company as the base for last disclosure made.\nI have considered the allegation levelled in the terms of reference the relevant material brought on record reply submissions of the Noticee and documents produced by the Noticee before undersigned.\nIt is also an admitted fact that the Noticee had bought shares of the Company during investigation period which resulted in change in its shareholding in the Company.\nThe limited question for determination is as to whether the Noticee had failed to make disclosures to the Company and BSE as required under Regulation 134A read with Regulation 135 of the PIT Regulations.\nIn this regard I note that Regulation 134A of the PIT Regulations had been inserted via an amendment and came into effect from August 16 2011.\nIt is noted from the record that first time the requirement for making disclosure to the Company and BSE triggered on July 03 2012 and the disclosure was to be made within 2 working days i.e  by July 05 2012.\nFurther there were 4 more instances during the investigation period wherein the Noticee failed to make disclosure to the Company and BSE under provision of Regulation 134A of the PIT Regulations.\nWith regard to provision of Regulation 134A of the PIT Regulations I note that as per the language of Regulation 134A and 5 the promoter is liable to make disclosures to the company and the exchange in Form D within two working days’ of the acquisition of shares if the change exceeds ₹ 5 lakh in value or 25000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower.\nI note that from the language of provision of Regulation 134A of the PIT Regulations it is crystal clear that if an entity is a promoter or part of promoter group of a listed company and if it has undertaken Adjudication Order in respect of in respect of Informed Technologies India Limited in the matter of Nagpur Power & Industries Limited. any transaction or transactions which resulted in change in excess of ₹5 lakh in value or 25000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights from last disclosure it has to make disclosure to the Company and to BSE in Form ‘D’.\nThe Noticee has submitted that the Company as a general disclosure had disclosed the shareholding of the Noticee to BSE in quarterly disclosures made during the investigation period and therefore it considered the shareholding disclosed by the Company as the base for last disclosure made.\nThus I hold that the Noticee liable for penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act which reads as under  “Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder — b. to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish

following factors namely  a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of

and the proposed acquirers on July 31 2009 for the sale of the issued and subscribed equity share capital of the company held by the erstwhile promoters as also change in management of the company.\nThe Shares Purchase Agreement was signed on July 31 2009 and the same is mentioned in the open offer.\nThe period of UPSI was considered to be from May 21 2009 to August 06 2009.\nOn August 07 2009 the managers to the offer issued a public announcement to the equity shareholders of SIPL on behalf of the acquirer.\nThe Noticee had failed to close the trading window from the day a proposal of change takeover of management of SIPL for the execution of the Shares Purchase Agreement was placed before the board on July 30 2009.\nFurther post the signing of the Shares Purchase Agreement the Noticee failed to disclose the holdings of Acquirer Ramayana in the ‘promoters’ category and instead wrongly included it under the ‘public’ category for the period from January 2010 to July 2010.\nThe Noticee also continued to report the holding of one Shri Chirantan Mukherji Shri Asamanja Mitra and Shri Mahiruha Mukherji under the category of “Promoter and Promoter Group” till July 08 2010 despite them having resigned from SIPL with effect from December 01 2009 thereby failing to provide the correct shareholding.\nUnder the provisions of Clause 35 of the Listing Agreement companies listed on BSE are required to file with BSE on a quarterly basis within 21 days from the end of each quarter their Shareholding Pattern in the specified format.\nI observe from the Noticee’s submission that Ramayana entered into the Shares Purchase Agreement with Shri.\nChirantan Mukherji and others as mentioned above to acquire 35% shares and paid more than 10 crores.\nThe negotiation persisted for considerable period prior to entering into the Shares Purchase Agreement on July 31 2009.\nThe purchase price was 80  per equity share of 10  when prevailing market price was 41.90. Certain share certificates and demat share transfer instruments were exchanged against Pay orders for 101392800 .\nPublic announcement for open offer appeared on August 06 2009 for purchase of 20% of shareholdings from ‘public category’.\nRamayana deposited the entire amount 100% of the consideration of 57122640  into the designated escrow account of HDFC Bank despite the option of purchaser to deposit only 25% of the amount payable. 51989 physical shares were transferred in normal course however the demat shares could No be transferred due to defects in the transfer documents.\nRamayana approached the Hon’ble Calcutta High Court ordinary original Civil Jurisdiction vide petition T No 3 of 2010 for appropriate order directions inter alia for affecting transfer of the shares purchased under SPA dated July 31 2009 for which payment was made on July 31 2009.\nSubsequently the matter was referred to arbitration under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 before the Hon’ble Chittatosh Mookherjee former Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court Arbitrator which came in favour of Ramayana at the end vide Arbitral award dated April 12 2012.\nThe name of the buyer Ramayana was entered into the list of members shareholder of the company only after a successful transfer in favour of it through delivery instruction slip by seller  Mr Chirantan Mukerjee and others to Axis Bank dated July 30 2012 after a waiting period of 3 years from the date of payment.\nMeanwhile Ramayana requested SBI the pledgee of the shares in question to release the pledge on shares in question on the basis of Settlement Agreement between the buyer and seller.\nFurther SBI vide its letter No IFB ADV RM11 19 286 dated October 18 2011 and letter No IFB ADV RM19 305 dated December 22 2012 agreed to repledge the shares in question in the name of the buyer.\nThey paid another 35 lakhs in course of settlement by way of arbitration in order to end the litigation and revive the company.\nLate Shri K. L. Surana erstwhile Company Secretary and Compliance officer of the company was handling the compliance matters and however expired on May 17 2012.\nTherefore since the shares in question were No registered in the name of the buyers I find that the compliance officer did No report it.\nUnder the provision of Clause 22d of the Listing Agreement the company will immediately on the date of the meeting of its Board of Directors held to consider or decide on e.g. interest on debentures and bonds and redemption amount of redeemable shares or of debentures and bonds will be payable etc. intimate the exchange within 15 minutes of the closure of the Board Meeting by Letter fax or if the meeting is held outside the city of Mumbai by fax telegram and any other information necessary to enable the holders of the listed securities of the company to appraise its position and to avoid establishment of a false market in such listed securities.\nI observe from the Noticee’s submission that the date of the Shares Purchase Agreement was signed on July 31 2009 which happened to be a Friday meaning that technically the date of public announcement ought to have been August 06 2009 i.e  Thursday the 4th working day from the date of SPA but public announcement was made on August 07 2009.\nIt is an admitted fact that the mistake lies on the part of Sumedha Fiscal Services Ltd Manager to the offer who was working in consultation with the Compliance officer in calculation of working days for public announcement.\nFurther as per Regulation 122 read with Clause 2.1 of Schedule II of the PIT Regulations prompt disclosure of price sensitive information should have been disseminated by listed companies to stock exchanges on a continuous and immediate basis.\nAs per said Regulations the compliance officer shall be responsible for setting forth policies procedures monitoring adherence to the rules for the preservation of “Price Sensitive Information” preclearing of Designated employee’ and their dependents’ trades directly or through respective department heads as decided by the company monitoring of trades and the implementation of the code of conduct under the overall supervision of the Board of the Listed company.\nIt is an admitted fact that mere circulation of code of conduct to all the board members during March end does No tantamount to a communication that the trading window had to be closed before public announcement.\nA formal communication indicating the trading window to be closed ought to have been made before the public announcement by the compliance officer.\nSection 27 of the Act inter alia provides that when an offence under the Act has been committed by a company every person who at the time the offence was committed was incharge of and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company as well as the company shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against.\nThis provision also applies to the violation of the regulations framed under the Act.\nThe Noticee must be held responsible for the conduct and actions of the compliance officer as stated in the regulations that the compliance officer must perform his duties under the overall supervision of the Board.\nAny person who is required under this Act or any rules made there under— a to furnish any information document books returns or report to a recognised stock exchange fails to furnish the same within the time specified therefore in the listing agreement or conditions or byelaws of the recognised stock exchange shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less for each such failure 17.\nPenalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided.\nWhoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act the rules or the regulations made or directions issued by the Board thereunder for which no separate penalty has been provided shall be liable to a penalty which may extend to one crore rupees.\nWhile imposing monetary penalty it is obligatory to consider the factors stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act and Section 23J of the SCRA which reads as under 15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default;

any attract monetary penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act? c If so what would be the quantum of monetary penalty that can be imposed on the Noticee after taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act?\nBefore proceeding further I would like to refer to the relevant provisions of the PIT Regulations1992 and the PIT Regulations 2015 as below Relevant provisions of PIT Regulations 1992 Disclosure of interest or holding in listed companies by certain persons  Initial Disclosure Continual disclosure.\n4A Any person who is a promoter or part of promoter group of a listed company shall disclose to the company and the stock exchange where the securities are listed in Form D the total number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights if there has been a change in such holdings of such person from the last disclosure made under Listing Agreement or under subregulation 2A or under this subregulation and the change exceeds Rs 5 lakh in value or 25000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower.\n5 The disclosure mentioned in subregulations 3 4 and 4A shall be made within two working days of a the receipts of intimation of allotment of shares or b the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights as the case may be.\nRelevant provisions of PIT Regulations 2015 Repeal and Savings.\n1The Securities and Exchange Board of India Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 are hereby repealed.\n2Notwithstanding such repeal— Adjudication Order in the matter of Onward Technologies Limited athe previous operation of the repealed regulations or anything duly done or suffered thereunder any right privilege obligation or liability acquired accrued or incurred under the repealed regulations any penalty forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against the repealed regulations or any investigation legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right privilege obligation liability penalty forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid shall remain unaffected as if the repealed regulations had never been repealed; and b anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken including any adjudication enquiry or investigation commenced or showcause notice issued under the repealed regulations prior to such repeal shall be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provisions of these regulations;\n3After the repeal of Securities and Exchange Board of India Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 any reference thereto in any other regulations made guidelines or circulars issued thereunder by the Board shall be deemed to be a reference to the corresponding provisions of these regulations.\nThe first issue for consideration is whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 134A read with Regulation 135 of the PIT Regulations 1992 on multiple occasions.\nFrom the available records I find that the Noticee who was one of the promoters of the OTL at the relevant time has disposed of 35000 shares twice i.e  total 70000 shares on June 19 2014.\nFurther the Noticee has disposed of 37045 shares on June 24 2014.\nIn addition to that on July 04 2014 the Noticee has disposed of 17925 shares and the total value of disposed of 17925 shares was Rs 1185739.\nA plain reading of Regulation 134A read with Regulation 135 of the PIT Regulations 1992 says that any person who is a promoter of a listed company shall disclose the number of shares held and the change in shareholding to every stock exchange where the securities are listed and to the Company within two working days from receipt of intimation of the allotment or acquisition or sale of shares if there has been a change in such holdings of such person from the last disclosure made under Listing Agreement or under subregulation 2A or under this subregulation and the change exceeds Rs 5 lakh in value or 25000 shares Adjudication Order in the matter of Onward Technologies Limited or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower.\nI note that the Noticee has disposed of a total 70000 shares on June 19 2014 and was required to make disclosures in terms of Regulation 134A read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992.\nFurther for the disposal of shares carried out by the Noticee on June 24 2014 and July 04 2014 the Noticee was required to file separate disclosures in terms of Regulation 134A read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992 for both the days.\nTherefore the Noticee was required to make disclosures in terms of Regulation 134A read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992 on total three 3 occasions during the examination period.\nThe Noticee has No disputed the facts of the case.\nFurther in his reply to the SCN dated August 08 2019 filed by the AR the AR has admitted that the Noticee has failed to make disclosures in terms of Regulation 134A read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992 due to oversight and ignorance 14.\nThe Company vide email dated August 21 2019 and letter dated August 22 2019 i.e  after hearing proceedings were concluded in the matter submitted copies of the letters dated August 20 2019 addressed to the BSE and the NSE wherein the Company has submitted the information about the change in the shareholdings of its promoters and directors including that of the Noticee in Form D in terms of Regulation 136 of PIT Regulations 1992.\nThe said letters bear acknowledgement stamp of the BSE and the NSE.\nThe date of the disclosures made by the promoter and directors including the Noticee in the said Form D to the Company is No available.\nFurther the Noticee in its reply dated August 08 2019 has accepted that he has No made the required disclosures to the stock exchanges and the Company.\nThe aforesaid disclosures submitted by the Company to the stock exchanges rely and refer to the disclosures made by the Adjudication Order in the matter of Onward Technologies Limited Noticee to the Company which appear to have been made subsequent to the said letter dated August 08 2019.\nThe impugned transactions were done during the period AprilMay 2014 and the Noticee was required to make disclosures to the Company and the Exchange in terms of Regulation 134A read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992 within two working days from the date of these transactions.\nTherefore I find that the Noticee has made disclosures to the Company after a delay of more than five 5 years.\nFurther there is no evidence available on record to show that the Noticee has made the disclosures to the stock exchanges directly as required in terms of Regulation 134A read with Regulation 135 of the PIT Regulations 1992.\nThe Hon’ble SAT in its order dated September 30 2014 in the matter of Akriti Global Traders Ltd Vs.\nSEBI had observed that “Obligation to make disclosures under the provisions contained in SAST Regulations 2011 as also under PIT Regulations 1992 would arise as soon as there is acquisition of shares by a person in excess of the limits prescribed under the respective regulations ....... if as a result of such acquisition receipt percentage of shares held by that person exceeds the limits prescribed under the respective regulations then it is mandatory to make disclosures under those regulations”.\nIn view of the above I am convinced that it is a fit case for the imposition of monetary penalty on the Noticee under the provisions of Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act which reads as under SEBI Act Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder— ... b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty which shall Adjudication Order in the matter of Onward Technologies Limited No be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees;\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act it is important to consider the relevant factors as stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act which reads as under Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer.\nWhile adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nExplanation.—For the removal of doubts it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15Eclauses b and c of section 15F 15G 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.\nHaving considered all the facts and circumstances of the case the material available on record the factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules I hereby impose monetary penalty of Rs 200000  Rs Two lakh only on the Noticee viz.\nDesai Finwealth Investments Securities Private Limited in terms of the provisions of Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act.\nThe amount of penalty shall be paid by way of demand draft in favor of “SEBI  Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai within 45 days of receipt of this order.\nThe said demand draft should be forwarded to “The Division Chief Division of Regulatory Action1 Enforcement Department EFD1 – DRA

d Do the violations if any on the part of the Noticees attract any penalty under Section 15A b of the SEBI Act 1992? e If yes what should be the quantum of penalty?\nBefore proceeding further it will be appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions of law which read as under Relevant provisions of the SAST Regulations Disclosure of acquisition and disposal 291Any acquirer who acquires shares or voting rights in a target company which taken together with shares or voting rights if any held by him and by persons acting in concert with him in such target company aggregating to five per cent or more of the shares of such target company shall disclose their aggregate shareholding and voting rights in such target company in such form as may be specified. 292 Any acquirer who together with persons acting in concert with him holds shares or voting rights entitling them to five per cent or more of the shares or voting rights in a target company shall disclose every acquisition or disposal of shares of such target company representing two per cent or more of the shares or voting rights in such target company in such form as may be specified. 293 The disclosures required under subregulation 1 and subregulation 2 shall be made within two working days of receipt of intimation of allotment of shares or the acquisition of shares or voting rights in the target company to  a Every stock exchange where the shares of the target company are listed; and b The target company at its registered address.\nDisclosure of encumbrance of shares.\n311The promoter of every target company shall disclose details of shares in such target company encumbered by him or by persons acting in concert with him in such form as may be specified. 313 The disclosure requirement under subregulation 1 and subregulation 2 shall be made within seven working days from the creation or invocation or release of encumbrance as the case may be to  a Every stock exchange where the shares of the target company are listed; and b The target company at its registered address.\nRelevant provisions of the PIT Regulations 1992 Disclosure of interest or holding in listed companies by certain persons  131 Any person who holds more than 5% shares or voting rights in any listed company shall disclose to the company in Form A the number of shares or voting rights held by such person on becoming such holder within 2 working days of — a the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares; or b the acquisition of shares or voting rights as the case may be. 133 Any person who holds more than 5% shares for voting rights in any listed company shall disclose to the company in Form C the number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights even if such change results in shareholding falling below 5% if there has been change in such holdings from the last disclosure made under subregulation 1 or under this sub regulation; and such change exceeds 2% of total shareholding or voting rights in the company.\nContinual Disclosure. 134 Any person who is a director or officer of a listed company shall disclose to the company and the stock exchange where the securities are listed in Form D the total number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights if there has been any change in such holdings of such person and his dependents as defined by the company from the last disclosure made 8under subregulation 2 or under this subregulation and the change exceeds Rs 5 lakh in value or 25000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower.\n134A Any person who is a promoter or part of promoter group of a listed company shall disclose to the company and the stock exchange where the securities are listed in Form D the total number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights if there has been a change in such shareholding of such person from last disclosure made under Listing Agreement or under subregulation 2A or under this subregulation and the change exceeds Rs 5 lakh in value or 25000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower. 135 The disclosure mentioned under subregulations 3 4 and 4A shall be made within two working days of  a The receipt of intimation of allotment of shares or b The acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights as the case may be.\nI find from the SCN that Ravi Bhandari Ravi Bhandari HUF Rekha Bhandari and Lollipop Fashions P. Ltd were the promoter and promoter group entities of ACL as per the shareholding pattern filed by ACL with BSE for the quarter ended on September 30 2013.\nIt was observed that during the examination period Shri Samir Ghosh and the promoter and promoter group entities of ACL had carried out certain transactions in the shares of ACL.\nThe Target Company Promoters had entered into three different agreements in 2013 with various persons for providing arranging loan to the Target Company Promoters.\nPursuant to the Agreements dated October 18 2013 with PragneshDoshi and Chirag N. Shah the following shares of the target Company were provided by Ravi Bhandari Date Name of the Party to whom shares are transferred to No of Shares transferred 18.10.2013 Chandrika J Sheth – 68000 1.09% PundrikNayak – 68000 1.09% KalpanaJigneshDoshi – 72000 1.15% PragneshDoshi 72000 1.15% 280000 4.49% 16.01.2014 Chandarika J Sheth – 142000 1.14% 142000 1.14% Total No of shares 422000 5.63% Date Name of the Party to whom shares are transferred to No of Shares transferred 19.10.2013 Chirag N.

Shah.\nPara3 of the said Agreement inter alia stated that PragneshDoshi and Chirag N. Shah would have no rights on shares and the shares were transferred only for security purpose.\nIn view of the above it was alleged in the SCN that the shares transferred by Ravi Bhandari to PragneshDoshi and Chirag N. Shah were in the nature of pledge.\nFurther BSE vide email dated January 22 2015 inter alia had stated that it had No received any disclosures under Regulation 311 of SAST Regulations 2011 from Ravi Bhandari with regard to pledging of shares in connection to agreements with PragneshDoshi and ChiragN.Shah.\nIt was therefore alleged in the SCN that Shri Ravi Bhandari had violated the provisions of Regulation 311 read with Regulation 313 of the SAST Regulations 2011.\nI further find that vide agreement dated November 27 2013 entered between Shri Ravi Bhandari Director of ACL and Shri Samir Ghosh for providing loan to the Target Company the promoter entities viz.\nRavi Bhandari Ravi Bhandari HUF Rekha Bhandari and Lollipop Fashions P. Ltd had transferred a total of 2500000 shares of ACL constituting 40.1% share capital of ACL to Shri Samir Ghosh on November 27 2013 and November 28 2013.\nThe details of the said transfer of shares is as under Date of transfer Name of the entity which credited the shares No of the shares credited 27.11.2013 Rekha Bhandari 636000 27.11.2013 Ravi Bhandari HUF 652000 27.11.2013 Lollipop Fashions Pvt Ltd 512000 28.11.2013 Ravi Bhandari 700000 Total 2500000 18.\nIt was observed that to finance the above loan facility entered into vide the agreement dated November 27 2013 Shri Samir Ghosh had entered into another agreement with Shri RakeshDhanuka on November 27 2013 for a loan amount of 2 Crore.\nThe details of the transfer of shares by Samir Ghosh to RakeshDhanuka is as under Date of transfer Name of the entity which credited the shares No of the shares credited 03.12.2013 Anand Kumar Dhanuka 1500000 19.\nThereafter I find that by virtue of allotment of bonus shares ratio 11 in December 2013 the total shares held by Shri Samir Ghosh became 5000000.\nFurther it was observed that due to some reason Shri Samir Ghosh was No in a position to provide the said loan facility and in view of the same 4500000 shares were credited to the account of Shri Ravi Bhandari in two trenches the details of which are as under Date of transfer Name of the entity which credited the shares No of the shares credited 16.12.2013 Ravi Bhandari 3500000 15.01.2014 Ravi Bhandari 1000000 20.\nIn view of the above transactions vide email dated December 04 2014 ACL was inter alia advised to furnish whether it had received any disclosures under Regulation 131 133 read with Regulation 135 of the PIT Regulations from Shri Samir Ghosh and Shri Anand Kumar Dhanuka.\nIn this regard ACL vide email dated January 12 2015 informed that it had No received any disclosures from Samir Ghosh and Anand Kumar Dhanuka.\nIt was therefore alleged in the SCN that the said Noticees by acquiring shares of ACL and thereafter failing to making the necessary disclosures had violated the provisions of Regulation 131 133 read with Regulation 135 of the PIT Regulations and Regulation 291 292 read with 293 of the SAST Regulations 2011.\nAs mentioned in para No 19 above I find that Shri Samir Ghosh had transferred back only 4500000 shares of ACL.\nTherefore it was alleged in the SCN that the promoter group of ACL viz.\nVide letters December 29 2015 Shri Ravi Bhandari Ravi Bhandari HUF and MsRekha Bhandari submitted their replies in the matter.\nApart from him Ravi Bhandari HUF Rekha Bhandari and lollipop Fashions P. Ltd had also provided shares to Shri Samir Ghosh and in total 2500000 shares were provided to him.\nLater on ACL had declared bonus shares in the ratio 11 record date – 05 12 2013 and therefore the total shares of ACL held be Shri Samir Ghosh increased to 5000000 shares.\nOn December 16 2013 Shri Samir Ghosh returned 3500000 shares and on January 15 2014 he had returned back 1000000 equity shares.\nThus instead of returning the shares in the demat accounts of the respective promoter entity he returned the shares to the account of Shri Ravi Bhandari and therefore Shri Ravi Bhandari had initiated to return the said shares held by him on behalf of other promoters.\nThe said transfer of shares in the respective demat accounts of the promoter group entities was done on January 01 2014 and January 03 2014.\nThe Noticee stated that somewhere in November 2013 Shri Ravi Bhandari was looking for financial affairs of ACL and had sought help for obtaining loan by transferring shares of ACL.\nIn order to create a good gesture Shri Ravi Bhandari had transferred shares of ACL in the demat account of Shri Samir Ghosh.\nIt was further observed by the Noticee that Shri Anand Kumar Dhanuka had mortgaged or sold the shares to one of his business associates but no payment was made to Shri Ravi Bhandari.\nI have carefully perused the charges leveled against the Noticees in the SCN and the replies submitted by the Noticees in the matter.\nFurther I find from the submissions made by Shri Ravi Bhandari that in support of his contention that he had made the necessary disclosures under Regulation 311 of the SAST Regulations 2011 to the target company and the stock exchange he has produced copies of the courier receipts for the letters sent by him to the BSE and ACL as documentary evidence in the matter.\nHowever I find that he has No provided the acknowledged copies of the letters so forwarded to the Target Company and BSE showing receipt of the same.\nThe information or disclosure must however reach the company.\nIn law anyone sending a written information through the agency of someone else appoints such agency as his agent.\nIf a letter is posted unless the law specifies the Postal Authority acts as an agent of the sender.\nIn the present case I also find that vide email dated January 22 2015 BSE has confirmed that it did No receive any disclosures under Regulation 311 of the SAST Regulations 2011 made by Shri Ravi Bhandari with regard to the pledge of shares in connection with agreements with Shri PragneshDoshi and Shri Chirag N Shah.\nRavi Bhandari Rekha Bhandari Ravi Bhandari HUF and Lollipop Fashions Pvt Ltd had transferred a total of 2500000 shares to Shri Samir Ghosh even before availing any loan from him as per the terms of the agreement.\nFurther I find that the said shares were duly transferred from the demat accounts of the said Noticees to the demat account of Shri Samir Ghosh.\nI note that upon the said transfer of sharesto the demat account of Shri Samir Ghosh he had become the deemed beneficial owner of the same.\nFurther as submitted by the Noticees upon declaration of the bonus shares the shares lying in the account of Shri Samir Ghosh had increased to 5000000 shares.\nAdmittedly as the said agreement and loan transaction did No materialize the shares were transferred back only to the account of Shri Ravi Bhandari in two trenches i.e  on December 16 2013 3500000 shares and January 15 2014 1000000 shares i.e  after 18 days and 48 days respectively.\nTherefore I find that the shares accounting to 4500000 were in possession of Shri Samir Ghosh for 18 days and 48 days and the rest 500000 were No even transferred back by Shri Samnir Ghosh to the promoter group entities during the relevant period.\nAlso I note that as per the material available on record and as submitted by the Noticees 1000000 shares of ACL were transferred to one Shri Anand Kumar Dhanuka by Shri Samir Ghosh on the instructions of Shri Ravi Bhandari.\nThe said factfurther establishes that Shri Samir Ghosh was having all the rights with respect to the said shares lying in his demat account which allowed him to transfer the said shares to the demat account of some other entity.\nI also note that vide email dated December 04 2014 ACL was inter alia advised to furnish whether any disclosures have been made by Shri Anand Kumar Dhanuka under the PIT Regulations.\nHowever I find that vide email dated January 12 2015 ACL informed that it did No receive any disclosures from the said Noticee.\nI note that the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal SAT in the case of Mrs. KomalNahata Vs.\nAdmittedly transfer of 375000 shares of Arvind International Limited constituted holding more than 5.35% shares of Arvind International Limited.\nSince no disclosure was made within 2 days of such acquisition it was apparent that the appellant has violated regulation 71 and regulation 72 of the SAST Regulations 1997.\nIn view of the above in exercise of powers conferred upon me under Sections 11 & 11B of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992 I hereby dispose of the SCNs dated March 23 2016 issued against the noticee nos.\n1 to 5 namely Ravi Bhandari Rekha Bhandari Ravi Bhandari HUF Lollipop Fashions Pvt Limited & Samir Ghosh by dropping the allegations levelled against them therein.\nI further find that there was a change in the shareholding of the promoter and promoter group for the period between June 30 2013 to June 28 2014.\nUpon the said changes in the shareholding the promoter group of ACL viz.\n15Y.No civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter which an adjudicating officer appointed under this Act or a Securities Appellate Tribunal constituted

viz.\nShri Ravi Bhandari by failing to make the necessary disclosures to the target company and the stock exchange upon creating encumbrance of shares pursuant to the agreements with Shri PragneshDoshi and Chirag Shah has violated the provisions of Regulation 311 read with 313 of the SAST Regulations 2011.\nThe said violations of the provisions of law warrant imposition of monetary

as under 15J‐Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15‐I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors

and such change exceeds 2% of total shareholding or voting rights in the company.”\nTakeover Code “Acquisition of 5 per cent and more shares or voting rights of a company.\n1 Any acquirer who acquires shares or voting rights which taken together with shares or voting rights if any held by him would entitle him to more than five per cent or ten per cent or fourteen per cent or fifty four per cent or seventy four per cent shares or voting rights in a company in any manner whatsoever shall disclose at every stage the aggregate of his shareholding or voting rights in that company to the company and to the stock exchanges where shares of the target company are listed.”\nSEBI conducted investigation into the trading in the shares of IQ Infotech Limited hereinafter referred to as the ‘Target Company’ and into possible violations of the provisions of the SEBI Act and various rules and regulations made thereunder.\nDuring the course of investigations it was observed that the Noticee had purchased 8986 shares & sold 928600 shares of the Target Company.\nFrom offmarket data it was observed that DSL had received 986094 shares from Mega Channel Computers Ltd on December 08 2004.\nIt was further observed that as on December 31 2004 DSL was holding 986094 shares which was 9.26% of the share capital of the Target Company and that its share holding had reduced to zero by March 31 2005.\nDuring investigation by SEBI it was alleged that the disclosures under Regulation 133 of the PIT Regulations and Regulation 7 1 of the Takeover Code were No made by the Noticee.\nI have carefully gone through the charges set out in the show cause notice and other documents on record.\nIt is clear that the Noticee had purchased 986094 shares from the offmarket on December 8 2004 which constituted 9.26% of the Target Company’s share capital.\nRegulation 71 of the Takeover Code mandates disclosure in case a person acquires more than 5% of the shares in a company.\nIt is clear from the language of regulation 71 of the Takeover Code that DSL was mandated to disclose the purchase of shares to the Target Company as it would entitle it to more than 5% shares in the share capital of the Target Company.\nUnder this regulation it is mandatory to disclose such acquisition to the Target Company and as well as the exchange and whether or No such disclosure was made is a question of fact.\nDuring investigation by SEBI it was alleged that no such disclosures were made to the Target Company.\nIt is also evident that as on December 31 2004 DSL was holding 986094 shares and by March 31 2005 the shareholding had reduced to zero. 986094 shares constitute 9.26% of the Target company and under regulation 133 any person who holds more than 5% of the share capital of a company has to disclose any change in that shareholding exceeding 2%.\nIt is clear from a plain reading of regulation 133 that the Noticee was required to disclose the change in it’s shareholding in the Target Company.\nThe violation of regulation 133 is a question of fact;

during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.;\nI have carefully persuaded the IR and the relevant documents available on record.\nIt is observed from the demat statement of the Noticee that it had hold 470000 shares of FTEL constituting 6.08% of the paid up capital of FTEL as on 18th November 2003.\nIt is observed from the available record that the Noticee had subsequently rematted all these shares.\nSubsequently the Noticee had received shares of FTEL in its demat account from various entities through offmarket transactions and transferred the same to other entities also through offmarket transfers.\nFurther the Noticee’s holding also reduced below 5% and fell to as low as 0% paid up capital of FTEL.\nConsidering the fact that the Noticee already had 6.08% of the capital any fluctuation above 2% should have been reported in accordance with Reg. 133 read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations.\nThe disclosure should have been made in the prescribed format i.e  in Form C to FTEL as prescribed in PIT Regulations under Regulation 133.\nIn the instant proceedings as mentioned hereinabove that the Noticee has No filed any reply to the SCN issued by the undersigned to defend itself from the violations as alleged in the SCN.\nHowever the Noticee had filed a written submission at the time of personal hearing only.\nI have carefully examined the submission of the Noticee and it is observed that the Noticee has infact submitted that it had sold its entire holding through offmarket transfer.\nFurther during the hearing proceeding also the Noticee submitted that it had intimated about the transfer shares to FTEL.\nHowever the Noticee expressed its inability to provide the details regarding its disclosure made to FTEL for which it had sought time to furnish the documentary evidence regarding its compliance to the regulatory requirement.\nLater on the Noticee had submitted an acknowledged copy of a letter dated January 5 2004 addressed to FTEL indicating the transfer of equity shares of FTEL.\nIt is observed from the available record that the letter was the document through which the Noticee claim to have informed regarding its change in shareholding in FTEL which was utterly No in Form C.\nThe letter dated January 5 2004 addressed to FTEL only indicates that the Noticee had sold all its shareholding by offmarket transfer which was effected through signing of blank transfer deeds for an undisclosed consideration.\nSince as discussed on para 7 the mandate of the Noticee is to file the disclosure in proper format of Form C as per Regulation 133 r w 135 of PIT Regulations.\nThe Format of Form C discussed above are inter alia as under  FORM C Securities and Exchange Board of India Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 [Regulation 133 and 6] Regulation 133—Details of change in shareholding in respect of persons holding more than 5% shares in a listed company Name & address of share holders Share holding prior to acquisition sale No & % of shares voting rights acquired sold Receipt of allotment advice acquisition of shares sale of shares specify Date of intimation to company Mode of acquisition on market purchase public rights preferential offer etc.\nNo & % of shares voting rights post acquisition sale Trading member through whom the trade was executed with SEBI Registration No of the TM Exchange on which the trade was executed Buy quantity Buy value Sell quantity Sell value 12.\nFurther the copy of the letter given by the Noticee to FTEL only reflects the number of equity shares transferred its face value and the mode of transfer which was offmarket transfer through signing blank transfer deeds.\nNo other details had been provided by the Noticee to FTEL as per requirement in Form C. 13.\nThe basic purpose of disclosure requirements is to bring about transparency in the securities market about any substantial change more than 2% in shareholding of the large shareholders holding more than 5% of the share capital in a listed company.\nTherefore in my opinion it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under section 15Ab of the SEBI Act.\nHowever for determining the quantum of monetary penalty under section 15Ab the factors prescribed under section 15J of the SEBI Act are to be considered which reads as under “15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default;  b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.”\nIn view of the above after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and exercising the powers conferred upon me U s 15I2 of the Act I hereby impose a penalty of Rs 100000

respect of any acquisition made pursuant to exemption provided for in this regulation the acquirer shall file a report with the stock exchanges where the shares of the target company are listed in

Continual disclosures.\n30 1 Every person who together with persons acting in concert with him holds shares or voting rights entitling him to exercise twentyfive per cent or more of the voting rights in a target company shall disclose their aggregate shareholding and voting rights as of the thirtyfirst day of March in such target company in such form as may be specified.\n1 Substituted by the SEBI Payment of fees Amendment Regulations 2014 w.e.f 23052014 for the words ”twenty five thousand” 2 Inserted by the SEBI Payment of Fees and Mode of Payment Amendment Regulations 2017 w.e.f 63 2017.\n2 The promoter of every target company shall together with persons acting in concert with him disclose their aggregate shareholding and voting rights as of the thirtyfirst day of March in such target company in such form as may be specified.\n3 The disclosures required under subregulation 1 and subregulation 2 shall be made within seven working days from the end of each financial year to— a every stock exchange where the shares of the target company are listed; and b the target company at its registered office.\nThe first issue for consideration is whether Noticee 1 and Noticee 2 have violated the provisions of Regulations 105 106 and 107 of the SAST Regulations 2011.\nI note that Noticee 1 and Noticee 2 were promoters of the Target Company.\nOn February 25 2013 there was interse transfer of 420750 shares representing 11.55% of the share capital of the Target Company among the promoters wherein Noticee 1 and Noticee 2 were the purchasers of the said shares.\nAs a result the Noticee 1 and Noticee 2 made a further acquisition of 420750 shares representing 11.55% of the share capital of the Target Company.\nIn the extant case the acquisition made by Noticee 1 and Noticee 2 pursuant to inter se transfer amongst promoters was exempt from obligation to make an open offer.\nHowever the acquirers viz.\nNoticee 1 and Noticee 2 were required to comply with Regulations 105 106 and 107 of SAST Regulations 2011.\nIn this regard I note that Noticee 2 has No filed any reply to the SCN though the same was duly served on it and did No avail of the hearing opportunity granted to it.\n“....appellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them No availed opportunity of personal hearing offered to them in the adjudication proceedings and therefore appellants are presumed to have admitted charges levelled against them in the show cause notices”.\nI observe that Noticee 1 in his letter dated July 17 2018 has stated that he was a part of the promoter group of the Target Company during the time when inter se transfer was carried out and that the Target Company was regularly filing the shareholding pattern under the Listing Agreement.\nHe has further stated that his shareholding was disclosed under the heading shareholding belonging to Promoter and Promoter group for the quarter ending March 2013’ and the same was in public domain.\nHence the Noticee 1 has stated that the public shareholders were made aware of the change in shareholding of Noticee 1 in the Target Company.\nNoticee 1 has further argued that he had filed report under Regulation 107 to SEBI in the year 2015 and the same was duly taken on record by SEBI.\nFurther Noticee 1 stated that he has submitted disclosure under Regulation 107 to SEBI on August 10 2015.\nIn this regard I note that there is a statutory obligation on the acquirer of the shares to submit information to the stock exchanges where the shares of the target company are listed under Regulations 105 and 106 of the SAST Regulations 2011 and to SEBI under Regulation 107 of the SAST Regulations 2011.\nThe obligations mandated under Regulations 105 106 and 107 of the SAST Regulations 2011 are independent.\nIn this context I note that Noticee 1 in his reply has admitted that he failed to comply with Regulations 105 and 106 of SAST Regulations 2011.\nI also note that the Noticee 1 has submitted disclosure under Regulation 107 to SEBI on August 10 2015 while the impugned transaction was carried out on February 25 2013.\nIn terms of Regulation 107 of the SAST Regulations 2011 an acquirer has to submit report to SEBI within 21 days of the acquisition.\nIn the present case I note that Noticee 1 filed disclosure under Regulation 107 to SEBI with a delay of more than 2 years.\nTherefore irrespective of the fact as to whether the shares were purchased from open market or shares were received on account of amalgamation or by way of bonus shares if as a result of such acquisition receipt percentage of shares held by that person exceeds the limits prescribed under the respective regulations then it is mandatory to make disclosures under those regulations.”\nThe second issue for consideration is whether Noticee 1 Noticee 3 Noticee 4 Noticee 5 and Noticee 6 have violated the provisions of Regulation 301 and 302 [read with Regulation 303] of the SAST Regulations 2011.\nI note that there is a common format for filing disclosures under Regulation 301 and Regulation 302 of SAST Regulations 2011.\nFurther it is stated in the said format that in case of promoters making disclosure under Regulation 302 no additional disclosure under Regulation 301 is required.\nI also note that Noticee 1 Noticee 3 Noticee 4 Noticee 5 and Noticee 6 were the promoters of the Target Company and holding shares or voting rights entitling them to exercise 25% or more of the voting rights in the Target Company as on the end of March 2014.\nIn view of the same Noticee 1 Noticee 3 Noticee 4 Noticee 5 and Noticee 6 were required to make disclosures mandated under Regulations 301 and 302 [read with Regulation 303] of SAST Regulations 2011 in respect of aggregate shareholding and voting rights as of March 31 2014 in the Target Company within seven working days from the end of financial year 201314 to—a every stock exchange where the shares of the Target Company are listed; and b the Target Company at its registered office.\nIt was alleged in the SCN that Noticee 1 Noticee 3 Noticee 4 Noticee 5 and Noticee 6 failed to make the requisite disclosures mandated under Regulations 301 and 302 of SAST Regulations 2011 to the stock exchange BSE for the financial year 201314.\nIn this regard I observe that Noticee 1 has submitted reply on behalf of himself Noticee 3 Noticee 4 Noticee 5 and Noticee 6 vide letter dated July 17 2018.\nI note from the above reply submitted by Noticee 1 on behalf of himself Noticee 3 Noticee 4 Noticee 5 and Noticee 6 that he has admitted that the disclosure was filed belatedly to BSE on the letterhead of the Target Company.\nI observe that the due date of disclosure under Regulations 301 and 302 was April 10 2014 for FY 201314.\nHowever I note that the disclosure was filed with BSE on April 16 2014 and was made on the letterhead of the Target Company.\nIn the reply letter dated July 17 2018 Noticee 1 has also stated that the Target Company was regularly filing the shareholding pattern under the Listing Agreement and that shareholding of Noticee 1 & 3 to 6 was disclosed under the heading shareholding belonging to Promoter and Promoter group for the quarter ending March 2014 and the same was in public domain.\nI note that in the matter of EAlly Consulting India Pvt Ltd.& Ors.\nObligations to make disclosures under Regulation 30 1 and 30 2 read with Regulation 30 3 of SAST Regulations 2011 is mandatory and is independent of the obligation to make the disclosures under the listing agreement.\nIn view of the same I am convinced that it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty on the Noticees under the provisions of Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act which reads as under Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder— ... b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty 3[which shall No be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees];\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act it is important to consider the factors relevantly as stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act which reads as under Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer.\nWhile adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nExplanation.—For the removal of doubts it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15Eclauses b and c of section 15F 15G 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.\nThe material available on record has No quantified the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticees and the loss 3 Substituted for the words ―”of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less” by the Securities Laws Amendment Act 2014 w.e.f 08092014. suffered by the investors as a result of the noncompliance committed by theNoticeesI note from documents available on record that Noticee 1 and Noticee 2 had each submitted demand draft for Rs 150000  to SEBI while submitting report under Regulation 107 of SAST Regulations 2011 in the year 2015.\nHaving considered all the facts and circumstances of the case the material available on record the factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules I hereby impose the following penalty under the provisions of Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act on the Noticees S.\nNo Name of the Noticees Provisions violated Penalty 1 1.\nM s Cressida Traders Pvt Ltd Regulations 301 and 302 of SAST Regulations 2011 Rs 200000 Rupees Two Lakh Only Payable jointly and severally 32.\nI am of the view that the said penalty is commensurate with the lapse omission on the part of theNoticeesThe amount of penalty shall be paid either by way of demand draft in favour of “SEBI  Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai or by epayment in the account of “SEBI  Penalties Remittable to Government of India” A c No 31465271959 State Bank of India Bandra Kurla Complex Branch RTGS Code SBIN0004380 within 45 days of receipt of this order.\nThe said demand draft or forwarding details and confirmations of epayments made in the format as given in table below should be forwarded to “The Division Chief Enforcement Department EFD1 – DRA III Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI Bhavan Plot No C –4 A “G” Block Bandra Kurla Complex Bandra E Mumbai –400 051.”\nCase Name 2.\nPayment is made for  like penalties disgorgement recovery settlement amount and legal charges along with order details 34.\nIn terms of the provisions of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules a copy of this order is being sent to the Noticees viz.\nShri Anand Kumar Arya M s Blue Blends Finance Limited M s Anand Kumar Arya HUF Ms. Indu Anand Arya Shri Aman Anand Arya and M s Cressida Traders Pvt Ltd and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.\nDate August 16 2018 K SARAVANAN Place Mumbai GENERAL MANAGER & ADJUDICATING OFFICER","In view of the same I am convinced that it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty on the Noticees under the provisions of Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act which reads as under Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.If any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder— ... b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty 3[which shall No be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees];Having considered all the facts and circumstances of the case the material available on record the factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules I hereby impose the following penalty under the provisions of Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act on the Noticees S.No Name of the Noticees Provisions violated Penalty 1 1.I am of the view that the said penalty is commensurate with the lapse omission on the part of theNoticeesThe amount of penalty shall be paid either by way of demand draft in favour of “SEBI  Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai or by epayment in the account of “SEBI  Penalties Remittable to Government of India” A c No 31465271959 State Bank of India Bandra Kurla Complex Branch RTGS Code SBIN0004380 within 45 days of receipt of this order.", "Explanation.—For the removal of doubts it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15Eclauses b and c of section 15F 15G 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section."))

Ramachandiran Chairman of the company.\nAnnouncement The Share Purchase Agreement was signed on May 11 2005 by Company’s and vMoksha’s officials after completion of all procedural formalities.\nThe allcash deal was closed at USD 19 million and includes earnout for achieving targeted financial milestones over a twoyear period vMoksha is a business that has 510 employees and global presence with offices in USA Europe Singapore and India.\n“We are looking at an aggressive growth to USD 100 mn revenue in the next 24 months and also at attaining a critical mass of 2000 employees by 2006.\nApart from executing the SPA on May 11 2005 the parties executed two other agreements as well on the same day.\nA share subscription agreement SSA and an 4 Escrow agreement were also executed between them.\nAs per the SSA the sellers were to subscribe to redeemable preference shares of the appellant company to be redeemed for cash at the expiry of eighteen months from the date of the subscription agreement.\nThe subscription price was to be paid by the sellers to the appellant company simultaneously on receipt of funds from the latter to the former under the SPA.\nIt appears that inter se disputes had by then arisen between Pawan Kumar and Rajeev Sawhaney the two sellers as a result whereof the board meetings of the vMoksha entities could No be convened.\nIt was then that the escrow agents emailed the request of the sellers to the appellant seeking permission from the appellant whether to release the documents lying with them.\nThe appellant then informed the stock exchanges on February 13 2006 as under “Dear Sir We wish to inform you that Helios & Matheson has initiated arbitration proceedings and has appointed its arbitrator viz Hon.\nJustice Shri N. V. Balasubramanian Retd Judge high Court Madras on Friday February 10 2006.\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India for short SEBI felt that the disclosures made by the appellant in its press release dated May 11 2005 and the disclosures made to the stock exchanges on May 12 2005 regarding the acquisition of vMoksha entities by the appellant contained misstatements and it withheld price sensitive information from the investors who were thereby misled.\nAccording to SEBI the appellant had violated regulations 3a 3d and 42k of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market Regulations 2003 read with clause 2.1 of the Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices for Prevention of Insider Trading in Schedule II to the Securities and Exchange Board of India Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992.\nThese regulations shall be referred to hereinafter as FUTP and PIT regulations respectively.\nSEBI decided to initiate adjudication proceedings against the appellant and appointed an 6 adjudicating officer who served a show cause notice dated March 18 2008 on the appellant levelling three charges against it.\nThe complete terms and conditions of the deal to acquire vMoksha.\nYou had No stated the entire facts in the press release dated May 11 2005 and disclosure dated May 12 2005 that the sellers would subscribe to preference shares as subsequent leg of the deal.\nIt has been alleged in the disclosure dated May 12 2005 you had informed that all the procedural formalities for acquisition of the 3 vMoksha companies were completed.\nHowever as per Clause 4 the SPA it has been observed that the completion shall take place on a date to be mutually agreed upon by both the parties on compliance of certain other clauses in the agreement but such date would No be later than 120 days from the signing of the SPA.\nIt has been alleged that you had prima facie misled investors by stating that the deal was complete whereas the deal was No complete in entirety and was still subject to compliance of certain conditions.”\nA reading of the aforesaid two charges makes it clear that these are based on the press release issued by the appellant on May 11 2005 a copy of which was sent to the stock exchanges on the following day.\nA copy of the press release is Exhibit E on the record and the corporate announcement that was flashed by BSE on its website is Exhibit F before us.\nThe appellant claims that it did No receive the aforesaid show cause notice from the adjudicating officer and that it came to know of the proceedings only when it received the letter dated April 23 2009 providing the appellant an opportunity of personal hearing in the matter.\nThe appellant then informed the adjudicating officer that it had No received 7 the show cause notice and asked for copy of the same.\nA copy of the show cause notice was then furnished to the appellant which filed its comprehensive reply on July 3 2009 denying the allegations.\nIt also filed its written submissions on June 28 2010 at the time of personal hearing.\nOn a consideration of the material collected by the adjudicating officer during the course of the enquiry conducted by him and taking note of the submissions made by the appellant he found that the two charges referred to above stood established.\nHe further found that the deal was yet to be completed after complying with clauses 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 of SPA and that the appellant had wrongly stated in the press release that the deal was complete.\nThis is what he has said in this regard “In view of the above it is very clear that the deal was to be completed after complying with Clauses 2.2.1 & 2.2.2 of the agreement.\nThe clause 2.2.1 provides about payment of consideration which happened on June 30 2005 only as per the own submission of the Noticee.\nThe Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices for Prevention of Insider Trading as stated in schedule II read with Regulation 122 of PIT Regulations requires that price sensitive information should be given by listed companies to stock exchanges and disseminated on a continuous and immediate basis.\nThe Listing Agreement also requires the companies to immediately inform the Exchange of all the events which will have bearing on the performance operations of the company as well as price sensitive information.\nAccordingly by his order dated January 31 2011 he imposed a monetary penalty of 25 lacs on the appellant for violating regulations 31 3d and 42k of the FUTP regulations.\nHe further imposed a penalty of 25 lacs for violating clause 2.1 of the Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices for Prevention of Insider Trading of Schedule II read with regulation 122 of PIT regulations.\nIt is against this order that the present appeal has been filed.\nThe adjudicating officer has found that the appellant had No disclosed that the sellers would be subscribing to the preference shares as subsequent 9 leg of the deal and that this information had been “willfully withheld”.\nLet us No examine whether the adjudicating officer was right in recording these findings.\nThe fact that the sellers would be subscribing to the preference shares and that the appellant company would be issuing those shares to them had No been mentioned in the press release.\nThe requirement of making necessary disclosures to the stock exchanges and through them to the investors is contained in clause 36 of the listing agreement that is executed between the stock exchanges and the issuer company.\nThis agreement is executed by every listed company with the stock exchanges where its securities are listed and it has a statutory force.\nThe relevant part of clause 36 requiring the necessary disclosures to be made from time to time reads thus “Listing Agreement Clause 36 – “.......... The Company will also immediately inform the Exchange of all the events which will have bearing on the performance operations of the company as well as price sensitive information.\nThe material events may be events such as 1 to 6 ............................................... 7 Any other information having bearing on the operation performance of the company as well as price sensitive information which includes but No restricted to i Issue of any class of securities. ii Acquisition merger demerger amalgamation restructuring scheme of arrangement spin off or selling divisions of the company etc. iii to viii ............................................ The above information should be made public immediately.”\nA reading of the aforesaid clause makes it clear that a company has to immediately inform the stock exchanges of the events which would have a bearing on its performance operations as well as price sensitive information.\nSubclause 7i of clause 36 requires the issuer company to inform the stock exchanges regarding issue of any class of securities.\nPrice sensitive information when published is likely to materially affect the price of the securities of a company and it is for this reason that clause 36 of the listing agreement mandates that such information should be made public at the earliest.\nThis is also the requirement of clause 2.1 of the Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices for Prevention of Insider Trading in schedule II to the PIT regulations which provides that “price sensitive information shall be given by listed companies to stock exchanges and disseminated on a continuous and immediate basis”.\nDisclosure of such information prevents insider trading.\nIt is pertinent to mention that PIT regulations prohibit a person from trading when he is in possession of unpublished price sensitive information.\nIt is alleged that it misled the investors by stating that the deal was complete when it was No complete in its entirety.\nThe resignation letters of the directors of vMoksha entities had also been handed over to these agents.\nClause 2.2.1 of the SPA required the appellant to pay to the sellers consideration for the acquisition of vMoksha entities computed at the rate of 1887.77 per share and this was to be remitted by wire transfer through normal banking channels and payment to the other individual sellers was to be made by bank draft.\nIt was also provided in this clause that on obtaining the 12 FIPB approval the sellers would subscribe to redeemable preference shares on their making payment of the application money.\nSection 20 of the Sale of Goods Act provides that where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the contract is made and it is immaterial whether the time of payment of price or the time of delivery of the goods or both is postponed.\nSince FIPB approval came on June 30 2005 the consideration was paid on that day.","He further imposed a penalty of 25 lacs for violating clause 2.1 of the Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices for Prevention of Insider Trading of Schedule II read with regulation 122 of PIT regulations.", " 15G"))

Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulations 291 read with 293 of SAST Regulations 2011?\nII. Does the violation if established attract monetary penalty under Section 15Ab of SEBI Act 1992?\nFINDINGS 5.\nBefore I proceed with the matter it is pertinent to mention the relevant legal provisions alleged to have been violated by the Noticee and the same is reproduced below SAST Regulations 2011 Disclosure of acquisition and disposal. 291 Any acquirer who acquires shares or voting rights in a target company which taken together with shares or voting rights if any held by him and by persons acting in concert with him in such target company aggregating to five per cent or more of the shares of such target company shall disclose their aggregate shareholding and voting rights in such target company in such form as may be specified. 293 The disclosures required under subregulation 1 and subregulation 2 shall be made within two working days of the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares or the acquisition of shares or voting rights in the target company to— a every stock exchange where the shares of the target company are listed; and b the target company at its registered office.\nIssue I Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulations 291 read with 293 of SAST Regulations 2011?\nI note that the allegation against the Noticee is mainly to the effect that it had No made disclosure under Regulations 291 read with 293 of SAST Regulations 2011.\nFrom the material available on record it is noted that the Noticee had acquired 10000 shares of MIL in offmarket transaction on 14.09.2016.\nThe transaction statement of the Noticee’s demat account provided by CDSL shows the credit of 10000 shares on 14.09.2016 and the consequent change in its shareholding from 413050 shares 4.92% to 423050 shares 5.04%.\nSince the shareholding of the Noticee crossed 5% of the total shares of MIL the Noticee was required to submit disclosures under Regulation 291 read with 293 of SAST Regulations 2011 regarding his shareholding to MIL and the stock exchanges within two working days from the date of the acquisition.\nIn this regard I note that the company i.e  MIL and BSE vide their respective emails dated 19.07.2019 and 21.07.2017 have confirmed that no disclosure under Regulation 291 read with 293 of SAST Regulations 2011 has been received by them from the Noticee.\nIssue II Does the violation if established attract monetary penalty under Section 15Ab of SEBI Act 1992?\nTherefore irrespective of the fact as to whether the shares were purchased from open market or shares were received on account of amalgamation or by way of bonus shares if as a result of such acquisition receipt percentage of shares held by that person exceeds the limits prescribed under the respective regulations then it is mandatory to make disclosures under those regulations.”\nThus the violation of Regulation 291 read with 293 of SAST Regulations 2011 makes the Noticee liable for penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act 1992 which reads as under – SEBI Act 1992 Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder— b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less;\n< Issue III Quantum of penalty.\nIn this regard the provisions of Section 15J of the SEBI Act and Rule 5 of the Rules require that while adjudging the quantum of penalty the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely;  a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nI also note that no prior default of the Noticee is available on record.\nI note that securities market is based on free and open access to information.\nAs a result of the violation committed by the Noticee the investors were deprived of valuable information which would have enabled them to take well informed decisions regarding their investments in the company.\nIn the present matter I note that Noticee has No made disclosure under Regulation 291 read with 293 of SAST Regulations 2011 to the company and stock exchange regarding its acquisition of 10000 shares leading to its shareholding from 413050 shares 4.92% to 423050 shares 5.04% i.e  breaching the 5% threshold.\nAccordingly taking into account the aforesaid observations and in exercise of power conferred upon me under section 15 I of the SEBI Act read with rule 5 of the Rules I hereby impose a penalty of Rs 100000  rupees One Lakh Only on the Noticee viz.\nWhitefeathers Realty Pvt Ltd under Section 15Ab of SEBI Act 1992 for the violations of the provisions of Regulation 291 read with 293 of SAST Regulations 2011.\nThe Noticee shall remit pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order either by way of Demand Draft in favour of “SEBI  Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai OR through online payment facility available on the website of SEBI i.e  www.sebi.gov.in on the following path by clicking on the payment link ENFORCEMENT  Orders  Orders of AO  PAY NOW.\nThe aforesaid Noticee shall forward said Demand Draft or the details confirmation of penalty so paid to “The Division Chief Enforcement Department  DRA3 Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI Bhavan Plot No C – 4 A “G” Block Bandra Kurla Complex Bandra E Mumbai – 400 051.”.\nThe Noticee shall also provide the following details while forwarding DD payment information a Name and PAN of the Noticee b Name of the case matter c Purpose of Payment – Payment of penalty under AO proceedings d Bank Name and Account Number e Transaction Number 17.\nIn the event of failure to pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of the receipt of this Order SEBI may initiate consequential actions including but No limited to recovery proceedings under section 28A of the SEBI Act 1992 for realization of the said amount of penalty along with interest thereon inter alia by attachment and sale of movable and immovable properties.\nIn terms of Rule 6 of the Rules copy of this order is sent to the Noticee and also to Securities and Exchange Board of India.\nDate September 01 2020 G Ramar Place Mumbai Adjudicating Officer http www.sebi.gov.in","Thus the violation of Regulation 291 read with 293 of SAST Regulations 2011 makes the Noticee liable for penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act 1992 which reads as under – SEBI Act 1992 Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.Accordingly taking into account the aforesaid observations and in exercise of power conferred upon me under section 15 I of the SEBI Act read with rule 5 of the Rules I hereby impose a penalty of Rs 100000  rupees One Lakh Only on the Noticee viz.", " 15G"))

and such change exceeds 2% of total shareholding or voting rights in the company.\n...... 5 The disclosure mentioned in subregulations 3 and 4 shall be made within four working days of a the receipts of intimation of allotment of shares or b the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights as the case may be.”\nI find from the SCN that the Noticee is one of the promoter entities of IHPML & was in possession of 2229500 23.59% shares of IHPML.\nI further find that the Noticee had acquired 200000 100000 and 668860 shares of IHPML on December 29 2003 April 17 2004 and March 31 2008 respectively which increased its shareholding by more than 2% on two occasions i.e  on acquiring shares on December 29 2003 25.\n71% and March 31 2008 33.85%.\nThe details of the acquisitions made by the Noticee on the three occasions is detailed below 9.\nSince the change in the Noticees shareholding exceeded 2% on said two occasions the Noticee was under an obligation to make necessary disclosure as prescribed under Regulation 133 read with 135 of the PIT Regulations.\nHowever it was alleged that the Noticee had failed to do so.\nThe Noticee further submitted that the transferor and the transferee in all the three transactions as mentioned in the SCN were either the promoters or formed a part of the Promoters Group of IHPML.\nThis change among the promoters was also reflected in the shareholding pattern filed under Clause 35 of the listing agreement for the quarter ended December 31 2003.\nFurther the Noticee stated that as the transaction involving the change in shareholding was known to the Board the requirement to file Form C under the PIT Regulations becomes a technical matter.\nWith regard to the transaction on March 31 2008 for 668860 shares which increased the shareholding of the Noticee to 33.85% the Noticee submitted that the necessary disclosures were made by it to the company and the company in turn had made the disclosures to BSE on March 31 2008 itself.\nThe Noticee vide its letter August 02 2014 submitted that as regards the inter se transfer of shares between the promoters on December 29 2003 IHPML had made the necessary disclosures with respect to the said change in shareholding pattern to the Stock Exchanges as required under Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement.\nI find from the Noticees reply dated July 24 2014 that as regards the acquisition of 200000 shares on December 29 2003 the said transaction was inter se transfer and the change in the promoter shareholding was known to the Board of company and consequently reflected in the shareholding pattern for the quarter ending December 31 2003.\nFurther I note from the Noticee‟s submissions that the company had made necessary disclosures to the stock exchanges under Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement.\nFurther I find that as regards the acquisition of 668860 shares on March 31 2008 the Noticee has submitted that the necessary disclosures were made to IHPML which in turn was submitted to the stock exchange by IHPML and has enclosed the documentary proof in support thereof at Annexure 1 & 2 of its reply.\nUpon perusal of the said documents I find that Annexure 1 to the reply does No consist of the disclosures made by the Noticee to IHPML under Regulation 13 3 of the PIT Regulations while Annexure 2 consists of the disclosure made by IHPML to the stock exchange under Regulation 13 6 of the PIT Regulations.\nFrom the foregoing I conclude that the Noticee by failing to make the necessary disclosure to the company IHPML upon acquiring 200000 shares increasing the shareholding from 23.59% to 25.71% on December 29 2003 has violated the provisions of Regulation 13 3 read with 13 5 of the PIT Regulations and thus is liable for monetary penalty under Section 15 A b of the SEBI Act which reads as under 15A.\nPenalty for failure to furnish information return etc.  If any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder ......... b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less;\nWhile imposing monetary penalty it is important to consider the factors stipulated in Section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under “15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.”\nIn view of the above after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and exercising the powers conferred upon me under section 15I 2 of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the said Rules I hereby impose a penalty of 200000  Rupees Two Lakh Only  on the Noticee viz.\nSunmet Holdings India Pvt Ltd erstwhile Sun Metals Pvt Ltd. under Section 15 Ab of the SEBI Act.\nThe above penalty amount shall be paid by the Noticee through a duly crossed demand draft drawn in favour of “SEBI – Penalties Remittable to Government of India” and payable at Mumbai within 45 days of receipt of this order.\nThe said demand draft shall be forwarded to The Division Chief Shri Debashis Bandyopadhyay ISD Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI Bhavan Plot No C4A „G‟ Block Bandra Kurla Complex Bandra E Mumbai – 400 051.\nIn terms of the Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules copy of this order is sent to the Noticee and also to Securities and Exchange Board of India.\nDate November 13 2014 D.

and Exchange Board of India SEBI conducted investigation in the scrip of Multi Commodity Exchange of India Limited hereinafter referred to as “Company MCX” for the period of April 27 2012 to July 31 2013.\nIt was observed in investigation that National Spot Exchange Limited NSEL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Financial Technologies India Ltd “FTIL” which also holds 26% of the shareholding in MCX.\nFurther all three companies i.e  NSEL FTIL and MCX are under a common management with common directors and employees.\nA Show Cause Notice dated April 27 2012 was issued by the Department of Consumer Affairs DCA SCN to NSEL.\nAs per the Investigating Authority the Unpublished Price Sensitive Information “UPSI” in respect of the shares of MCX was the implication of the DCA SCN dated April 27 2012 issued to NSEL i.e  suspension of short selling by its Members pairing of contracts and settlement of contracts beyond 11 Adjudication Order in respect of Dilip Tambe in the matter of MCX days and impending payment defaults by the members of NSEL and loss of reputation of Promoters and Management of MCX.\nIt was observed that any news impacting business of NSEL will automatically impact share price of its holding company i.e  FTIL and associate companies i.e  MCX and any news impacting credentials of Promoters and Management of FTIL NSEL and MCX will also impact the share price of MCX therefore suspension of trading by NSEL was a negative news.\nAs per the Investigating Authority the UPSI came into existence on April 27 2012 upon the issuance of the SCN to NSEL by the DCA and it ceased to exist when NSEL suspended trading in all contracts except eseries contracts and deferred settlement of all pending contracts on July 31 2013.\nFTIL being the holding company of NSEL Directors and Officers of FTIL were reasonably expected of having access to the UPSI which emanated from its wholly owned subsidiary company i.e  NSEL.\nIt was observed in the investigation conducted by SEBI that Shri Dilip Tambe “Noticee” was holding position of Senior Vice President  Communications from September 10 2012 to April 02 2014 and thus a senior level employee of FTIL during the UPSI period to whom the “Code of Conduct for Prevention of Insider Trading” as specified by FTIL was applicable.\nIn that capacity Noticee was reasonably expected of having access to the UPSI which emanated from NSEL and thus an insider under SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 hereinafter referred to as PIT Regulations 1992.\nIt was alleged that the Noticee being an insider before the outbreak of NSEL irregularities avoided losses by selling 875 shares of MCX on May 22 2013 when in possession of UPSI and thereby violated provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992 read with Regulation 122 of Adjudication Order in respect of Dilip Tambe in the matter of MCX SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 2015 hereinafter referred to as “PIT Regulations 2015”.\nThe undersigned was appointed as Adjudicating Officer under section 15I of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992 hereinafter referred to as “SEBI Act” read with rule 3 of SEBI

should No be initiated and penalty be No imposed under section 15G of the SEBI Act 1992 for the alleged violations specified in the SCN.\nVide letter dated January 25 2018 Noticee submitted its reply to the SCN and the summary of his submissions is as follows  You are requested to consider the order dated January 05 2018 passed by the Ld.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 9.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the present case are  I. Whether Noticee avoided losses by selling 875 shares of MCX on May 22 2013 when in possession of UPSI and thereby violated provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992? and II.\nDoes the violation if any attract monetary penalty under section 15G of SEBI Act?\nBefore moving forward it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of PIT Regulations 1992 which reads as under “Prohibition on dealing communicating or counselling on matters relating to insider trading.\nNo insider shall— i either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person deal in securities of a company listed on any stock exchange when in possession of any unpublished price sensitive information; or” 11.\nI have perused the written submissions of the Noticee documents available on record and the WTM order dated January 05 2018 in the Adjudication Order in respect of Dilip Tambe in the matter of MCX same matter in different proceedings.\nHaving considered the same I record my findings hereunder.\nFurther the transactions in question i.e  sale of 875 shares of MCX on May 22 2013 as specified in the SCN is also a matter of record.\nNoticee has brought to my attention the fact that WTM of SEBI vide Order dated January 05 2018 under sections 111 114b and 11B of SEBI Act on the same set of facts and allegations had exonerated certain individuals in a separate proceedings against them in the scrip of MCX and the period of UPSI was the same as in the SCN in the instant adjudication proceedings.\nI note that in the said WTM order there was a specific finding with regard to the periodicity of the UPSI which is as under “25.\nHaving answered the first issue in the affirmative the next issue for consideration is whether the “price sensitive information” was unpublished during the period of investigation.\nIn this regard it is noted that on October 3 2012 an article appeared in the Economic Times a widely distributed financial newspaper which contained information relating to the issuance of SCN dated April 27 2012 to NSEL majority of the contents of the SCN allegations against NSEL with regard to violation of conditions of DCA notification dated June 5 2007 and the gist of NSEL’s reply to the SCN.\nThe article also covered the possible action that could be taken by DCA against NSEL i.e  withdrawal of exemption granted to NSEL vide the notification dated June 5 2007.\nIt was also alleged that NSEL did No have a stock check facility for validating a members position.\nThe article categorically mentioned that failure on part of NSEL to provide a satisfactory explanation to the allegations levelled in the SCN would result in withdrawal of exemption granted to NSEL vide notification dated June 5 2007.\nThe said withdrawal of exemption in turn would have had a cascading effect on the contracts being traded on NSEL payment defaults in relation thereto and the eventual loss to the reputation of the promoters management of NSEL.\nIn terms of rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules copies of this order are sent to Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.\nDate April 27 2018 Prasanta Mahapatra Place Mumbai Adjudicating Officer","", "The undersigned was appointed as Adjudicating Officer under section 15I of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992 hereinafter referred to as “SEBI Act” read with rule 3 of SEBI Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalty by Adjudicating Officer Rules 1995 hereinafter referred to as the ‘Adjudication Rules’ to inquire into and adjudge under section 15G of the SEBI Act the alleged violations of provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992 read with Regulation 122 of PIT Regulations 2015 by the Noticee."))

Noticees as required under Regulation 112 of the SEBI Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations 1997 hereinafter referred to as the SAST Regulations.\nIt was also observed that Shri

required under Regulation 13 4 read with Regulation 13 5 of SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 hereinafter referred to as the PIT Regulations.\nHowever it was observed that the said

will be appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions of the SAST and PIT regulations which read as under SAST Regulations 112 No acquirer who together with persons acting in concert with him holds fiftyfive per cent 55% or more but less than seventyfive per cent 75% of the shares or voting rights in a target company shall acquire either by himself or through or with persons acting in concert

whichever is lower.\n5 The disclosure mentioned in subregulations 3 4 and 4A shall be made within two working days of a the receipts of intimation of allotment of shares or b the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights as the case may be.”\nI find from the SCN that based on the shareholding pattern filed by certain companies including Arcotech SEBI had carried out an examination in the said scrip.\nUpon examination it was revealed that certain entities being promoter and promoter group of Arcotech had acquired shares of company through bulk deals beyond the permissible limit on two occasions.\nThe details of acquisition made through bulk deals are as under Name of the Acquirer Date of Acquisition Number of Shares Acquired % of Shareho lding Acquire d Compliance under Regulation 71 and 71A of the Takeover Regulations and Regulation 133 and 134 of PIT Regulations.\nShri Arvind Kumar Saraf February 05 2010 100000 0.50% Delay of 1394 and 1392 days in complying with Regulation 134 of PIT Regulations.\nShri Arvind Kumar Saraf February 08 2010 100000 0.50% 10.\nFrom the above table it is noted that Shri Arvind Kumar Saraf Promoter entity of Arcotech along with the PACs as mentioned in para 2 above had acquired 100000 shares each on February 05 2010 and February 08 2010 constituting 0.50% on both occasions of the total paid up equity capital of Arcotech through bulk deals.\nUpon the said acquisitions the Noticees were required to make public announcement in terms of Regulation 112 of the SAST Regulations as the said acquisition was through bulk deals.\nHowever it was alleged that the Noticees had No made the public announcement.\nThe shareholding of the promoter and promoter group from quarter ended March 2009 to September 2011 is as under Scrip Name Arcotech Limited Quarter ended % Promoter group holding during the quarter ending Increase % Mar 2009 60.45 Jun 2009 60.45 Sept 2009 60.45 Dec 2009 60.45 Mar 2010 61.95 1.50% Jun 2010 61.95 Sept 2010 61.95 Dec 2010 61.95 Mar 2011 63.94 1.99% Not through bulk deal Jun 2011 64.93 Sept 2011 64.93 12.\nFurther upon acquiring the said shares Shri Arvind Kumar Saraf being the promoter of the company was also required to make necessary disclosures under Regulation 134 read with Regulation 135 of the PIT Regulations which were allegedly made with a delay of 1394 days and 1392 days i.e  on December 02 2013 as per the disclosures made by the Arcotech to BSE.\nTherefore it was alleged in the SCN that the Noticees had violated the provisions of Regulation 11 2 of SAST Regulations and additionally that Shri Arvind Kumar Saraf had violated the provisions of Regulation 13 4 read with Regulation 13 5 of the PIT Regulations in the matter.\nVide common letter dated June 05 2014 Shri Arvind Kumar Saraf submitted a reply on behalf of all theNoticeesThe Noticees submitted that the promoters promoter group of the company already held 55% or more but less than 75% of the then total paid up equity and voting share capital of the company.\nThe Noticees have submitted a copy of the contract notes issued by the broker in support of their submission.\nThe Noticees have also submitted that as per the information available on BSE the transaction would be pronounced as bulk deal only if the quantity of the shares of the company bought sold by any person entity is more than 0.50% of the number of equity shares of the company listed on the exchange.\nHowever it is the case of the Noticees that it is clear from the documents available that the acquisition of 100000 equity shares each on both the occasions constituted 0.50% only of the then equity and voting share capital of Arcotech.\nI have carefully perused the material available on record and the submissions made by theNoticeesI note that Regulation 112 of the SAST Regulations makes it clear that any acquirer together with PACs holding 55% but less than 75% of the shares or voting rights in a company acquires any additional shares or voting rights together with PACs in that company has to make a public announcement.\nHowever the second proviso to Regulation 112 of the SAST Regulations makes an exception to the said Regulations.\nIt states that an acquirer along with PACs can acquire up to 5% additional shares or voting rights subject to that the said acquisition is made through open market purchase in normal segment on the stock exchange but No through bulk deal block deal negotiated deal preferential allotment.\nSEBI vide Circular bearing No SEBI MRD SE Cir7 2004 dated January 14 2004 had explained in para 1.1 of the said Circular that a bulk deal constituted of “all transactions in a scrip on the exchange where total quantity of shares bought sold is more than 0.5% of the number of equity shares of the company listed on the exchange”.\nThus the quantitative limit of 0.5% could be reached through one or more transactions executed during day in the normal market segment.\nShri Arvind Kumar Saraf along with the PACs had acquired shares of Arcotech on two occasions during the relevant period.\nI note that the said acquisitions were for a quantity of 100000 shares each on February 05 2010 and February 08 2010 which constituted for 0.50% on both the occasions of the number of equity shares listed on the exchange.\nThe said SEBI circular clearly states that if any person entity buys or sells shares of a company which is more than 0.50% of the number of equity shares of the company listed on the exchange then only it shall be treated as a bulk deal.\nI further find that upon the said acquisitions Shri Arvind Kumar Saraf being the promoter of Arcotech was required to make necessary disclosures as prescribed under the PIT Regulations which were made by the said Noticee with a delay on both the occasions.\nPenalty for failure to furnish information return etc. If any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made there under a.... b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15Hii of the Act it is important to consider the factors stipulated in Section 15J of the Act 1992 which reads as under 15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.”\nThe disclosure made under Regulation 13 4 read with 13 5 of the PIT Regulations by a promoter is made public only through Stock Exchange.\nFurther I hereby impose a monetary penalty of 400000  Rupees Four Lakh Only on Shri Arvind Kumar Saraf under Section 15Ab of the Act for violating the provisions of Regulation 13 4 read with 13 5 of the PIT Regulations.\nThe penalty amount as mentioned above shall be paid by the Noticee through duly

regulation 131 & regulation 133 read with regulation 135 of PIT Regulations as specified in the said SCN.\nI find from the records that the SCN was issued through Speed Post with acknowledgement card SPAD at the last known address of the Noticee at “531 L Model Town Karnal Haryana 132 001” and the same was delivered.\nNoticee vide letter dated October 12 2011 acknowledged the receipt of the SCN

the Noticee did No give any reply.\nFurther it is observed from the documents available on record that the Noticee had No submitted any consent application in the matter.\nThe Noticee had also failed to submit any reply to the SCN.\nIn the interest of natural justice and in order to conduct an inquiry in terms of rule 43 of the Rules the Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing on March 22 2012 vide notice dated March 02 2012 sent through SPAD to the Noticee.\nThe said hearing notice was delivered.\nMs. Sasmita Parida Practicing Company Secretary Authorized Representative hereinafter referred to as “AR” appeared on behalf of the Noticee.\nTherefore I request the AO to take a lenient view in the matter.\nThe undersigned acceded to the request of the Noticee AR and allowed time till April 02 2012 to submit the additional written submissions in the matter.\nNoticee vide letter dated March 29 2012 submitted additional written submissions in the matter which inter alia stated as under “...............  A major fire incident in the factory premises of the Company in May 2000 resulted in closure of its operations.\nDue to financial constraints the company could No pay the annual listing fees to the Stock Exchanges.\nThe Trading was suspended by BSE in the year 2002.\nI have carefully perused the submissions of the Noticee and the documents available on record.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the present case are  a.\nWhether Noticee had violated the provisions of regulation 131 and regulation 133 read with regulation 135 of PIT Regulations? b.\nDoes the violation if any attract monetary penalty under section 15Ab of the SEBI Act? c.\nIf so what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act?\nBefore moving forward it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of PIT Regulations which reads as under 13.\nDisclosure of interest or holding by directors and officers and substantial shareholders in a listed company – Initial Disclosure 1.\nAny person who holds more than 5% shares or voting rights in any listed company shall disclose to the company in Form A the number of shares or voting rights held by such person on becoming such holder within 4 working days of — a the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares; or b the acquisition of shares or voting rights as the case may be 2.\n....... Continual Disclosure 3 Any person who holds more than 5% shares or voting rights in any listed company shall disclose to the company in Form C the number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights even if such change results in shareholding falling below 5% if there has been change in such holdings from the last disclosure made under sub regulation 1 or under this subregulation; and such change exceeds 2% of total shareholding or voting rights in the company.\n4 .............. 5 The disclosure mentioned in subregulations 3 and 4 shall be made within 4 working days of a the receipts of intimation of allotment of shares or b the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights as the case may be.\nAs per regulation 131 of PIT Regulations any person whose shareholding is in excess of 5% in any listed company has to make the required disclosure to the company in a prescribed format within 4 working days from a the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares or b the acquisition of shares or voting rights.\nAs per regulations 13 3 & 135 of PIT Regulations any person who is holding more than 5% of shares or voting rights in any listed company has to make the required disclosure to the company if there is any change in shareholding of such person by more than 2% of total shareholding or voting rights in the company in a prescribed format within 4 working days from a the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares or b the acquisition of shares or voting rights as the case may be.\nUpon perusal of the documents available on record I find that the shareholding of the Noticee in AVCL prior to July 31 2006 was 262500 shares i.e  4.38% of total shareholding of AVCL.\nFurther Noticee had acquired 78300 shares i.e  1.31% of total shareholding of AVCL on July 31 2006 through off market transaction.\nThus by means of said acquisition the shareholding of the Noticee had increased from 262500 shares i.e  4.38% of total shareholding of AVCL to 340800 shares i.e  5.69% of total shareholding of AVCL on July 31 2006.\nNoticee while crossing the threshold limit of 5% specified under regulation 131 of PIT Regulations on July 31 2006 was required to make the disclosures to the company i.e  AVCL as per regulation 131 of PIT Regulations i.e  within four working days from the date of acquisition i.e  by August 04 2006 which the Noticee had failed to do.\nFurther I find that the shareholding of the Noticee in AVCL prior to August 10 2006 was 340800 shares i.e  5.69% of total shareholding of AVCL.\nNoticee had acquired 31600 shares i.e  0.53% of total shareholding of AVCL on August 10 2006 and 112000 shares i.e  1.87% of total shareholding of AVCL on August 21 2006 through off market transactions.\nThus by means of said acquisitions the shareholding of the Noticee in AVCL had increased from 340800 shares i.e  5.69% of total shareholding of AVCL to 484600 shares i.e  8.08% of total shareholding of AVCL on August 21 2006.\nAs there was a change of more than 2% of shareholding of the Noticee in AVCL on August 21 2006 the Noticee was required to make the disclosures to the company i.e  AVCL in accordance with the provisions of regulation 133 read with regulation 135 of PIT Regulations i.e  within four working days from the date of acquisition i.e  by August 25 2006 which the Noticee had failed to do.\nIn the instant case I find from the submissions of the Noticee that the Noticee has No disputed the fact that its shareholding in AVCL prior to July 31 2006 was 262500 shares i.e  4.38% of total shareholding of AVCL and it had acquired 78300 shares i.e  1.31% of total shareholding of AVCL through off market transaction on July 31 2006 thereby its shareholding had increased from 4.38% to 5.69% of total shareholding of AVCL.\nFurther Noticee has No disputed the fact that it had acquired 143600 shares i.e  2.39% 31600 shares i.e  0.53% of total shareholding of AVCL on August 10 2006 and 112000 shares i.e  1.87% of total shareholding of AVCL on August 21 2006 of total shareholding of AVCL thus by means of said acquisitions its shareholding had increased from 5.69% to 8.08%.\nAVCL vide its letter dated May 10 2011 mentioned that it did No have any documentary evidence to confirm about Noticee having made the necessary disclosures required under regulation 131 & regulation 133 read with regulation 135 of PIT Regulations to it.\nIn terms of regulations 131 & 133 of PIT Regulations disclosures are required to be made to the company.\nThe fact that complete information should be disclosed to the company is also evident from the provisions of regulations 131 & 135 of PIT Regulations which casts an obligation on the person whose shareholding crosses the specified threshold limits to disclose to the company the acquisition of shares within 4 working days.\nThe provisions of section 15A b of SEBI Act is reproduced hereunder 15A.\nPenalty for failure to furnish information return etc. If any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder  a............... b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefore in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefore in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less. c............... 27.\nIn view of the foregoing I am convinced that it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under section15A b of the SEBI Act.\nWhile determining the quantum of monetary penalty under section 15A b I have considered the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under “15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.”\nFurther similar disclosures were also required to be made under regulation 71 read with regulation 72 of SEBI Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations 1997 hereinafter referred to as ‘SAST Regulations’.\nFurther I also note that the Noticee had No made the disclosures required under regulation 71 read with regulation 72 of SAST Regulations.\nSEBI vide common order dated September 19 2011 had imposed a monetary penalty of 1800000 on Noticee Lee Hotels Conchem Jas Expoship ADB Trade and Anuj Dewan  300000 in terms of section

Appellate Tribunal vide order dated February 02 2012.\nAfter taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case I hereby impose a monetary penalty of 25000 Rupees twenty five

findings hereunder 12.\nIssue a Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of regulation 134A r w regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992? a I have noted from the available records that the Noticee is a promoter of the company.\nShareholding of the Noticee as on June 30 2012 was 623200 shares representing 4.45% of the share capital of the Company.\nFurther the shareholding of the Noticee as on September 30 2012 was 653200 shares representing 4.67% of the share capital of the Company which shows that there was an increase in shareholding of 30000 shares i.e  excess of 25000 shares of the company by the Noticee.\nIn this regard I note from the regulation 134A r w 135 of PIT Regulations 1992 that being a promoter of the company and as the change of shareholding exceeds 25000 shares of the company the Noticee was required to make relevant disclosures to the Company and BSE within two working days of the allotment of the shares or acquisition of shares.\nHowever Noticee made disclosures to the BSE on December 03 2014 under the provision of regulation 134A r w 135 of PIT Regulations 1992 with a delay of approximately more than two 2 years. b Further as per the available record it is noted that Popular in its letter received at SEBI on December 02 2014 informed that the company has No received the required disclosures from the Noticee under the provision of regulation 134A r w 135 of PIT Regulations 1992.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Ms. Kokilaben Patel in the matter of Popular Estate Management Limited 13.\nIssue b Do the violations if any on the part of the Noticee attract monetary penalty under section 15Ab of the SEBI Act 1992? a In respect of imposition of monetary penalties I cannot ignore the historical case of Honble Supreme Court of India in the matter of The Chairman SEBI Vs.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder— b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Ms. Kokilaben Patel in the matter of Popular Estate Management Limited 14.\nIssue c  If so what would be the quantum of monetary penalty that can be imposed on the Noticee after taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act 1992?\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under sections 15Ab of the SEBI Act1992 it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J Of the SEBI Act 1992 read with Rule 52 of the Adjudication Rules which reads as under The SEBI Act 1992 Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer 15J  While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.”\nI observe that the material available on record does No quantify any disproportionate gains or unfair advantage if any made by the Noticee and the loss if any suffered by the investors due to nondisclosures under Regulation 13 4A r w 135 of SEBI PIT Regulations 1992.\nTherefore taking into
