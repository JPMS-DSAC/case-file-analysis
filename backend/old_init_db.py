to as the SAST Regulations.\nThe shares of ATCL are listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange Limited hereinafter referred to as BSE.\nIt was observed by SEBI that  Mr Kiritbhai Nathubhai Vaghani hereinafter referred to as ‘Noticee 1’  Mr Vipulkumar Nathubhai Vaghani hereinafter referred to as ‘Noticee 2’  Mr Jitubhai Nathubhai Vaghani hereinafter referred to as ‘Noticee 3’ Ms. Ashmitaben

provisions of Rule 41 of the Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should No be initiated against the Noticees and why penalty if any should No be imposed on the Noticees under the provisions of Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act for the alleged violations of Regulation 292 read with Regulation 293 of the SAST Regulations by theNoticees4.\nThe SCN was delivered to the Noticees at their addresses available on record.\nAt the same time a digitally signed copy of SCN was also delivered to the Email IDs of the Noticees as obtained from the Demat statements of the Noticees and also mentioned in the SCN.\nThe Noticees vide their respective emails dated October 13 2020 requested for time to submit their replies to the SCN.\nSubsequently  Mr Anil Shah vide his Email dated October 22 2020 requested for time to submit replies on behalf of theNoticees6.\nThereafter vide letter dated October 29 2020 the Noticees were provided time till November 15 2020 to submit their replies to the SCN.\nFurther an opportunity of personal hearing was also provided to the Noticees on November 23 2020.\nIn response to the same the Noticees vide 3 separate letters dated November 06 2020 submitted their respective replies to the SCN.\nIn the said replies the Noticees while accepting their respective transactions have contended that they were No Persons Acting in Concert PAC and therefore no disclosure requirements were triggered by their trades in the scrip of ATCL.\nSubsequently  Mr Anil Shah Advocate appeared as authorized representative AR of the Noticees in the personal hearing on November 23 2020 and reiterated the submissions made by the Noticees in their respective replies dated November 06 2020.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 9.\nI have taken into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case and the material available on record the issues that arise for consideration in the present case are a Whether the Noticees have violated the provisions of Regulation 292 read with Regulation 293 of the SAST Regulations? b Does the violation if any attract monetary penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act? c If so what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act?\nBefore moving forward it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of the SAST Regulations which read as under SAST Regulations 2011 292 Any person who together with persons acting in concert with him holds shares or voting rights entitling them to five percent or more of the shares or voting rights in a target company shall disclose the number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights even if such change results in shareholding falling below five percent if there has been change in such holdings from the last disclosure made under subregulation or under this subregulation; and such change exceeds two per cent of total shareholding or voting rights in the target company in such form as may be specified.\n3 The disclosures required under subregulation 1 and sub regulation 2 shall be made within two working days of the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares or the acquisition of shares or voting rights in the target company to – a Every stock exchange where the shares of the target company are listed; and b the target company at its registered office.\nBefore proceeding further it would be appropriate to mention the relevant facts of the case leading to the present proceedings against theNoticeesIt was alleged that the Noticees are persons acting in concert PAC in terms of the definition of PACs as defined under Regulation 21q of SAST Regulations.\nOn the other hand the Noticees have argued that they are No PACs.\nTherefore it is relevant to discuss the definition of PACs as given in Regulation 21q of SAST Regulations q “persons acting in concert” means— 1 persons who with a common objective or purpose of acquisition of shares or voting rights in or exercising control over a target company pursuant to an agreement or understanding formal or informal directly or indirectly cooperate for acquisition of shares or voting rights in or exercise of control over the target company.\n2 Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing the persons falling within the following categories shall be deemed to be persons acting in concert with other persons within the same category unless the contrary is established — i a company its holding company subsidiary company and any company under the same management or control; ii a company its directors and any person entrusted with the management of the company; iii directors of companies referred to in item i and ii of this sub clause and associates of such directors; iv promoters and members of the promoter group; v immediate relatives; vi a mutual fund its sponsor trustees trustee company and asset management company; vii a collective investment scheme and its collective investment management company trustees and trustee company; viii a venture capital fund and its sponsor trustees trustee company and asset management company; viiia an alternative investment fund and its sponsor trustees trustee company and manager; ix…. x a merchant banker and its client who is an acquirer; xi a portfolio manager and its client who is an acquirer; xii banks financial advisors and stock brokers of the acquirer or of any company which is a holding company or subsidiary of the acquirer and where the acquirer is an individual of the immediate relative of such individual Provided that this subclause shall No apply to a bank whose sole role is that of providing normal commercial banking services or activities in relation to an open offer under these regulations; xiii an investment company or fund and any person who has an interest in such investment company or fund as a shareholder or unitholder having No less than 10 per cent of the paidup capital of the investment company or unit capital of the fund and any other investment company or fund in which such person or his associate holds No less than 10 per cent of the paidup capital of that investment company or unit capital of that fund Provided that nothing contained in this subclause shall apply to holding of units of mutual funds registered with the Board;\nExplanation.—For the purposes of this clause “associate” of a person means— a any immediate relative of such person; b trusts of which such person or his immediate relative is a trustee; c partnership firm in which such person or his immediate relative is a partner; and d members of Hindu undivided families of which such person is a coparcener;\nFrom the above definition of PACs I note that the immediate relatives are deemed to be PACs and in such a case the burden of proof shifts on such deemed PACs to prove that they are No PACs.\nIn the present matter I note that Noticees 1 2 and 3 are brothers and Noticees 4 5 and 6 are the respective wives of Noticees 1 2 and 3.\nTherefore the Noticees collectively fall under the category of immediate relatives and therefore they are deemed to be PACs.\nIn such a case the burden of proof shifts to the Noticees to prove that they are No PACs.\nHowever I note that while the Noticees have vehemently argued that they are No PACs no evidence whatsoever has been submitted in the support of such argument.\nI further note from the letters dated March 18 19 and April 09 2019 of the Noticees submitted in reply to the letter dated March 11 2019 of SEBI that the Noticees have No raised any such issue in the said letter.\nTherefore the argument of the Noticees that they are No PACs seems to be an afterthought.\nI further note from the trading pattern of the Noticees that they were holding shares of ATCL at least from January 01 2017.\nThereafter suddenly all of them started selling their respective shares from March 17 2017 and they had completely sold their respective holdings on or before March 30 2017.\nThis clearly suggest some kind of meeting of minds among theNoticeesTherefore the argument of the Noticees that they are No PACs cannot be accepted in the facts of the present matter.\nIt was observed from the Demat statements of the Noticees that each of the Noticees were holding 250000 shares of ATCL at the start of relevant period in their respective Demat Accounts.\nThus the Noticees were together allegedly holding 1500000 shares of ATCL which amounts to 12.06% of total shareholding of the Company.\nThereafter the Noticees had entered into the following transactions in the scrip of ATCL during the relevant period Name of the Noticee Date of sale No of shares sold Shareholding post transactions Shareholding post transactions in % terms Shareholding of the Noticees as on 01.01.2017 1500000 12.06% Kiritbhai Nathubhai Vaghani 17.03.2017 13000 1400000 11.25% Vipulkumar Nathubhai Vaghani 16000 Jitubhai Nathubhai

were cumulatively holding 12.06% of total shareholding of ATCL.\nThereafter they started selling shares of ATCL starting from March 17 2017.\nDuring the period March 17 2017 to March 30 2017 the Noticees had sold most of their shareholding of ATCL.\nI further note from the above table that the Noticees sold a total of 1386300 shares of ATCL and as a result the cumulative shareholding of the Noticees in ATCL had decreased to 113700 shares i.e  0.91% of total shareholding of the Company.\nWith the sale of 300000 shares by the Noticees on March 20 2017 out of the said 1386300 shares sold by the Noticees the cumulative shareholding of the Noticees had reduced by more than 2% from their cumulative shareholding on March 16 2017 and consequently the Noticees were obligated to make necessary disclosure to BSE and ATCL as stipulated under Regulation 292 read with Regulation 293 of the SAST Regulations.\nSimilarly the cumulative shareholding of the Noticees was again reduced by more than 2% on March 22 2017 and March 28 2017 when they sold 274000 shares and 100000 shares respectively on the abovementioned dates.\nConsequently the Noticees were obligated to make necessary disclosure to BSE and ATCL as stipulated under Regulation 292 read with Regulation 293 of the SAST Regulations.\nI note from available records that no disclosure from the Noticees under Regulation 292 of SAST Regulations is available on BSE website.\nI thus note that the Noticees have together failed to comply with the disclosure obligations that ware triggered on March 20 2017 March 22 2017 and March 28 2017.\nIn this context I observe that Honble SAT has consistently held that the obligation to make disclosure within the stipulated time is a mandatory obligation and penalty is imposed for noncompliance with the mandatory obligation.\nIn this regard I note the observation of the Hon’ble SAT in its order dated September 30 2014 in the matter of Akriti Global Traders Ltd Vs SEBI “Obligation to make disclosures under the provisions contained in SAST Regulations 2011 as also under PIT Regulations 1992 would arise as soon as there is acquisition of shares by a person in excess of the limits prescribed under the respective regulations and it is immaterial as to how the shares are acquired.\nTherefore irrespective of the fact as to whether the shares were purchased from open market or shares were received on account of amalgamation or by way of bonus shares if as a result of such acquisition receipt percentage of shares held by that person exceeds the limits prescribed under the respective regulations then it is mandatory to make disclosures under those regulations.”\nFurther the Honble SAT in its Order dated June 10 2019 in the matter of Vipul Shah Vs SEBI had observed that  Under Regulations 292 and 293 of the SAST Regulation 2011 the acquirer was required to disclose the disposal of shares representing 2% or more within two days of the sale.\nThe sale made by the appellant resulted in the decrease in his shareholding which exceeded the benchmark limit as prescribed under Regulation 292 of the SAST Regulations.\nSuch disclosures were required to be made which was No done.\nThus the appellant had violated the aforesaid Regulations.”\nIn view of the above I find that the violations of Regulation 292 read with Regulation 293 of the SAST Regulations is established against theNoticeesThe Honble Supreme Court of India in the matter of Chairman SEBI vs  Shriram Mutual Fund {[2006] 5 SCC 361} held that  In our view the penalty is attracted as soon as contravention of the statutory obligations as contemplated by the Act is established and therefore the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes immaterial.\nHence we are of the view that once the contravention is established then the penalty has to follow and only the quantum of penalty is discretionary.\nIn view of the same I am convinced that it is a fit case for imposition of monetary penalty on the Noticees under the provisions of Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act which reads as under Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder— b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less 25.\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act it is important to consider the factors relevantly as stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act which reads as under Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer.\nWhile adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nExplanation.—For the removal of doubts it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15Eclauses b and c of section 15F 15G 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.\nThe material available on record also has No quantified the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticees and the loss suffered by the investors as a result of the noncompliance committed by theNoticeesHowever I note that the Noticees had failed to make disclosure under the provisions of Regulations 292 read with 293 of SAST Regulations on three different occasions during the relevant period.\nThis clearly shows that there was a repetition of violation by theNoticeesORDER 27.\nAfter taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case material facts on record and also the factors mentioned in the preceding paragraphs I in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules hereby impose the following penalty on the Noticees under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act for the failure on their part to comply with the relevant provisions of law.\nName of the Noticee Penalty Kiritbhai Nathubhai Vaghani Rs 100000  Rupees One Lakh only Vipulkumar Nathubhai Vaghani Rs 100000  Rupees One Lakh only Jitubhai Nathubhai Vaghani Rs 100000  Rupees One Lakh only Ashmitaben Kiritbhai Vaghani Rs 100000  Rupees One

omission on the part of theNoticees28.\nThe Noticee shall remit pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order through Demand Draft in favour of “SEBI Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai or the online payment facility available on the website of SEBI i.e  www.sebi.gov.in on the following path by clicking on the payment link ENFORCEMENT > Orders >

of penalty within 45 days of the receipt of this Order recovery proceedings may be initiated under Section 28A of the SEBI Act for realization of the said amount of penalty along with interest thereon inter alia by attachment and sale of movable and immovable properties.\nIn terms of the provisions of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules a copy of this order is being sent to the Noticees

Ramalinga Raju ExChairman Satyam Computer Services Limited No known as Tech Mahindra Limited hereinafter referred to as Satyam Computers the company admitting and confessing the following I would like to bring the following facts to your notice 1.\nThe Balance Sheet carries as of September 30 2008 a.\nInflated nonexistent cash and bank balances of 50.40 billion rupees $1.04 billion as against 53.61 billion reflected in the books. b.\nAn accrued interest of 3.76 billion rupees which is nonexistent. c.\nAn understated liability of 12.30 billion rupees on account of funds arranged by me. d.\nAn overstated debtors position of 4.90 billion rupees as against 26.51 billion reflected in the books 2.\nFor the September quarter Q2 we reported a revenue of 27.00 billion rupees and an operating margin of 6.49 billion rupees 24 pct of revenues as against the actual revenues of 21.12 billion rupees and an actual operating margin of 610 million rupees 3 percent of revenues.\nThis has resulted in artificial cash and bank balances going up by 5.88 billion rupees in Q2 alone.\nOrder in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd The gap in the Balance Sheet has arisen purely on account of inflated profits over a period of last several years limited only to Satyam standalone books of subsidiaries reflecting true performance.\nWhat started as a marginal gap between actual operating profit and the one reflected in the books of accounts continued to grow over the years.\nIt has attained unmanageable proportions as the size of company operations grew significantly annualized revenue run rate of 112.76 billion rupees in the September quarter 2008 and official reserves of 83.92 billion rupees.\nThe differential in the real profits and the one reflected in the books was further accentuated by the fact that the company had to carry additional resources and assets to justify higher level of operations  thereby significantly increasing the costs.\nEvery attempt made to eliminate the gap failed.\nAs the promoters held a small percentage of equity the concern was that poor performance would result in a takeover thereby exposing the gap.\nIt was like riding a tiger No knowing how to get off without being eaten.\nThe aborted Maytas acquisition deal was the last attempt to fill the fictitious assets with real ones.\nMaytas investors were convinced that this is a good divestment opportunity and a strategic fit.\nOnce Satyams problem was solved it was hoped that Maytas payments can be delayed.\nBut that was No to be.\nWhat followed in the last several days is common knowledge.\nI would like the Board to know 1.\nThat neither myself No the Managing Director including our spouses sold any shares in the last eight years  excepting for a small proportion declared and sold for philanthropic purposes.\nThat in the last two years a net amount of 12.30 billion rupees was arranged to Satyam not reflected in the books of Satyam to keep the operations going by resorting to pledging all the promoter shares and raising funds from known sources by giving all kinds of assurances Statement enclosed only to the members of the board.\nSignificant dividend payments acquisitions capital expenditure to provide for growth did No help matters.\nEvery attempt was made to keep the wheel moving and to ensure prompt payment of salaries to the associates.\nThe last straw was the selling of most of the pledged share by the lenders on account of margin triggers.\nThat neither me No the Managing Director took even one rupee dollar from the company and have No benefitted in financial terms on account of the inflated results.\nNone of the board members past or present had any knowledge of the situation in which the company is placed.\nEven business leaders and senior executives in the company such as Ram Mynampati Subu D T.R. Anand Keshab Panda Virender Agarwal A.S. Murthy Hari T S.V. Krishnan Vijay Prasad Manish Mehta Murali V Sriram Papani Kiran Kavale Joe Lagiola Ravindra Penumetsa;\nJayaraman and Prabhakar Gupta are unaware of the real situation as against the books of accounts.\nNone of my or Managing Directors immediate or extended family members has any idea about these issues.\nHaving put these facts before you I leave it to the wisdom of the board to take the matters forward.\nHowever I am also taking the liberty to recommend the following steps 1.\nA Task Force has been formed in the last few days to address the situation arising out of the failed Maytas acquisition attempt.\nThis consists of some of the most accomplished leaders of Satyam Subu D T.R. Anand Keshab Panda and Virender Agarwal representing business functions and A.S. Murthy Hari T and Murali V representing support functions.\nI suggest that Ram Mynampati be made the Chairman of this Task Force to immediately address some of the operational matters on hand.\nRam can also act as an interim CEO reporting to the board.\nMerrill Lynch can be entrusted with the task of quickly exploring some Merger opportunities.\nYou may have a restatement of accounts prepared by the auditors in light of the facts that I have placed before you. http uk.reuters.com finance?lc=intmb1001 http uk.reuters.com finance?lc=intmb1001 Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd I have promoted and have been associated with Satyam for well over twenty years now.\nI have seen it grow from few people to 53000 people with 185 Fortune 500 companies as customers and operations in 66 countries.\nSatyam has established an excellent leadership and competency base at all levels.\nI sincerely apologize to all Satyamites and stakeholders who have made Satyam a special organization for the current situation.\nI am confident they will stand by the company in this hour of crisis.\nIn light of the above I fervently appeal to the board to hold together to take some important steps.\nMr T.R.

notices of personal hearings issued by SEBI after issuance of SCNs dated March 22 2010 the noticees cited uniform reasons for seeking adjournments of hearings as summarised in the following table Name of noticee Brief submissions made in reply to notices of hearings  Mr Ramalinga Raju Earlier for the hearings scheduled in the years 2010 and 2011  Mr Ramalinga Raju stated that a. he was under treatment for Hepatitis C at the Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences Hyderabad; b. he was No in possession of documents for replying to SEBI.\nSubsequently he requested SEBI to keep the proceedings in abeyance till a reasonable period after the final conclusion of the CBI trial pending against the noticess before the Special Court at Hyderabad.\nMr Rama Raju  Mr Rama Raju submitted that he was No in a position to find time to prepare and send complete replies to SEBIs SCNs or instruct a Counsel or representative to attend the SEBI hearing on his behalf as he was preoccupied with CBI trial.\nHe also requested SEBI to keep the proceedings in abeyance till the conclusion of the aforesaid CBI trial.\nMr Vadlamani Srinivas  Mr Srinivas interalia stated that a. he is No in possession

requested that the SEBI proceedings should be kept in abeyance till the conclusion of the CBI trial.\nMr G Ramakrishna  Mr G Ramakrishna requested SEBI to keep the proceedings in abeyance till the conclusion of CBI trial.\nMr V S Prabhakara Gupta  Mr Prabhakara Gupta a. stated that he does No have access to the records for replying to the SCNs;\nOrder in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd b. requested SEBI to defer the hearing in the present case until the conclusion of the CBI trial and he may be granted access to internal audit records in the possession of Satyam Computers.\nWith a view to conduct the present proceedings on the dates which do No clash with the dates fixed by the trial court SEBI vide letter dated April 25 2012 sought details of the dates of hearing in the trial court from the noticees and asked them to indicate whether the proceedings are fixed before the trial court on Saturdays also.\nHowever the noticees replied inter alia that the CBI trial was continuously in progress and the Saturdays were to be used by them to correspond with their counsel indulge in work relating to the CBI trial and hence the SEBI proceedings would be required to be kept in abeyance till the CBI trial is concluded.\nConsidering the facts and circumstances of this case a last and final opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the noticees on May 12 2014 and a notice dated April 30 2014 was issued to them in that regard.\nThey were clearly advised that the pendency of CBI trial cannot be accepted to be a justifiable reason for their nonattendance on all the dates fixed for personal hearings.\nThey were also advised that the proceedings cannot be kept in abeyance anymore as sufficient time and opportunities of being heard have been given to them in adherence to the principles of natural justice.\nThey were also advised that if they fail to avail this last opportunity of personal hearing either in person or through their authorized representative SEBI will proceed to conclude the matter and pass such order as it deems fit based on the material available on record without any further intimation.\nHowever the noticees again chose No to avail the said opportunity of personal hearing despite service of notices upon them in that regard.\nI note that in this case several opportunities have been provided by SEBI to the noticees adhering to the principle of natural justice and considering the importance of the case and mixed questions of facts and law being involved therein.\nWhile these considerations were weighing in the mind of SEBI authorities and they were making a sincere effort to afford the noticees adequate opportunities to represent their matter before the competent authority with reference to the SCNs issued to them the noticees did No show any sincerity in availing these opportunities and instead employed delaying tactics.\nFrom their written replies I note that all the noticees have generally denied the charges allegations mentioned in the SCNs but none of them have submitted their specific replies on merits.\nIt is pertinent to mention that the noticees were in charge of affairs of Satyam Computers regarding its management administration and or its finances and accounts.\nAs such they could have filed their replies on merits.\nHowever they chose to avoid the same citing extraneous reasons such as non availability of information from Satyam Computers etc. Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd 15.\nI further note that vide various notices of personal hearings all the noticees had been given option by SEBI to appear in person or through their advocates and or through their authorized representatives.\nIt had also been clarified to the noticees that the pendency of CBI trial cannot be accepted as a justifiable reason for their nonattendance on the dates fixed for personal hearings and they could appear for personal hearing through authorised representative s.\nHowever they chose to evade the opportunities and delay the proceedings for extraneous reasons as cited in above para.\nI further note that even during pendency of CBI trial the noticees could have appeared on any Saturday s.\nI find that the reason cited by them for their inability to appear on Saturday s is No cogent as they could appear on Saturday s either in person or through their authorised representativess.\nEven when the final and last opportunity of personal hearing in these proceedings was afforded to the noticees on May 12 2014 they chose to avoid and evade the same too despite service of notice dated April 302014 whereby they were clearly advised that if they fail to appear for personal on this final date the proceedings shall be completed on the basis of material available on record.\nIt is noted that while the matter was proceeded for consideration on the basis of material available on record since the noticees had chosen to avoid the opportunities  Mr Vadlamani Srinivas vide letter dated May 9 2014 received by SEBI on May 12 2014  Mr B Ramalinga Raju vide letter through his advocates dated May 26 2014 and  Mr Rama Raju vide letter dated May 26 2014 requested for crossexamination of certain persons entities.\nIt is relevant to mention here that though the instant proceedings had commenced by issuance of the first set of SCNs in the year 2009 these noticees never made such a request.\nI note that the request of cross examination subsequent to or on the last date of personal hearing despite clear advice that SEBI shall proceed in the matter on the basis of material available on record if they fail to avail the opportunity of personal hearing is also a device adopted to further delay the proceedings.\nNonetheless I note that these requests are open requests without making out a case for cross examination.\nIn the facts and circumstances of this case no prejudice would be caused if the cross examination as requested by some of the noticees without making a case for the same is denied.\nIn this regard it is relevant to refer to the following judgment of Honble Supreme Court in the matter of Transmission Corpn of A. P. Ltd and others vs  Shri Rama Krishnan Rice Mil 2006 3 SCC 74 “In order to establish that the crossexamination is necessary the consumer has to make out a case for the same.\nMerely stating that the statement of an officer is being utilized for the purpose of adjudication would No be sufficient in all cases.\nIf an application is made requesting for grant of an opportunity to cross examine any official the same has to be considered by the adjudicating authority who shall have to either grant the request or pass a reasoned order if he chooses to reject the application.\nIn that event an Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd adjudication being concluded it shall be certainly open to the consumer to establish before the Appellate Authority as to how he has been prejudiced by the refusal to grant an opportunity to crossexamine any official.\nAs has been rightly noted by the High court in the impugned judgment where the reliance is only on accounts prepared by a person crossexamination is No necessary.\nBut where it is based on reports alleging tampering or pilferage the fact situation may be different.\nBefore asking for crossexamination the consumer may be granted an opportunity to look into the documents on which adjudication is proposed.\nIn that event he will be in a position to know as to the author of which statement is necessary to be crossexamined.\nThe applications for crossexamination are No to be filed in a routine manner and equally also No to be disposed of by an adjudicator in casual or routine manner.\nThere has to be application of mind by him.\nSimilarly as noted above the consumer has show as to why crossexamination is necessary.”\nIn this case as mentioned hereinabove several opportunities to submit replies to the SCNs were given and several dates for personal hearing were fixed but the noticees failed to avail of the opportunities despite service of notices.\nThe facts and circumstances discussed above clearly show that noticees have been deliberately keeping themselves away from the proceedings and adopting dilatory and delaying tactics.\nThe detailed narration given hereinabove makes it clear that SEBI afforded numerous opportunities to the noticees as it was making a sincere effort to adhere to the principle of natural justice especially considering the importance of the case and the mixed question of facts and law being involved therein but the noticees as it is very clear from their conduct were interested in only evading the specific reply and delaying the proceedings.\nSince it is clear No that the noticees are No willing to avail the opportunities afforded to them and are adopting dilatory and delaying tactics there would No be any denial of natural justice if these proceedings are concluded on the basis of material available on record.\nIn this regard it is relevant to mention the following judgment of Honble Supreme Court in the case of Haryana Financial Corporation vs  Kailashchand Ahuja [2008 9 SCC 31] ..the theory of reasonable opportunity and principle of natural justice have been evolved to uphold the rule of law and to assist the individual to indicate his just rights.\nWhether in fact prejudice has been caused to an employee or No on account of denial to him of the report has to be considered on the facts and circumstances of each case.\nEven in cases where procedural requirements have No been complied with action cannot be ipso facto illegal or void unless it is shown that nonobservance has prejudicially affected the delinquent.\nIn view of the above I find that all the noticees have deliberately avoided the several opportunities granted to them and have adopted dilatory and delaying tactics therefore I am of the view that the present proceedings cannot be kept in abeyance anymore and proceed to decide the matter on the basis of material available on record.\nOrder in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd 19.\nI have considered the SCNs issued to the respective noticees and relevant material available on record.\nI note that the SCNs have been issued to all the noticees on the basis of same set of facts and circumstances.\nI therefore deem it appropriate to deal with the respective SCNs issued to all the five noticees herein by way of this common order.\nBefore dealing with the charges and allegations in the SCNs against the noticees herein I deem it necessary to refer to provisions of the SEBI Act PFUTP Regulations 2003 and PIT Regulations 1992 alleged to be violated by the noticees.\nThese provisions are reproduced hereafter

SEBI investigation and that are basis of allegation charges as described in the respective SCNs are narrated in the following paragraphs.\nFrom the books of account hereinafter referred to as „the books‟ of Satyam Computers it was observed during investigations that Satyam Computers had more than 125 bank accounts with various banks throughout the world.\nThe books reflected that as on 30 th September 2008 Satyam Computers disclosed ₹ 5312.62 crore as cash and bank balance in the financial statements. a.\nAn amounts of ₹ 1784.67 crore i.e  33.5% was lying in Current A c 120559 of BoB New York branch. b.\nAn amount of ₹ 3319.17 crore i.e  62.5% in Fixed Deposits with five banks.\nThe balances as per statement of the current account of Satyam Computers provided by BoB New York branch and that presented in books showed huge and substantial differences as described in the following table Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd Dates Balance as per the books in ₹ crore Actual Balance as per BoB confirmation in ₹ crore Difference in balance in ₹ crore 30Jun07 543.06 48.89 494.18 30Sep07 415.32 29.47 385.86 31Dec07 595.79 25.24 570.55 31Mar08 855.00 43.85 811.15 30Jun08 1275.58 21.89 1253.69 30Sep08 1782.60 50.72 1731.88 24.\nIt was revealed that Satyam Computers had been maintaining the following two sets of bank statements for its current account No 120559  a.\n“Daily Bank Statement” received through email and printed and filed in accounts wing ; and b.\n“Monthly Bank Statement” received through „internal‟ courier from its Chairman‟s office.\nFrom the two sets of bank statements it was observed that the closing balances as well as the number of debit and credit entries in the two said statements differed substantially as shown in the table below in ₹ crore Item Year ending 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 A 125.93 229.63 208.05 288.28 373.60 977.56 350.61 872.66 B 5.64 16.09 39.95 16.07 44.95 28.06 49.92 43.74 C 120.29 213.54 168.10 272.21 328.66 949.51 300.69 811.28 A  Balance as per books of accounts of company B  Balance as received directly from the bank C  Difference between A and B i.e  the overstated balance 26.\nAs on September 30 2008 the actual balance in the current account of Satyam Computers as confirmed by BoB New York branch was USD 10836569 whereas in the Monthly Bank Statement such balance was shown as USD 379612384.\nBoB New York branch had confirmed the balances as per the Daily Bank Statement but No with the Monthly Bank Statement.\nIt was observed that entries were passed on a regular basis using the data contained in the Daily Bank Statement but it was the Monthly Bank Statement that was used for the purpose of monthly closing of the bank ledger and preparation of monthly bank reconciliation statement.\nThe changes for prior entries were carried out through the rectification module available in the accounting package.\nThe transactions in the Monthly Bank Statement which were No appearing Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd in the Daily Bank Statement were accounted as and when the differences were identified.\nIt was also observed that certain transactions in the Daily Bank Statement were No accounted for without assigning reasons.\nFurther transactions already accounted for were reversed.\nMonthly Bank Statements were manipulated showing additional entries largely in the nature of extra receipts.\nOn examination of the process of receipt of confirmation statement from BOB New York branch it was observed that a standard form to confirm account balances was prepared and balances as per the books were filled in.\nThis filledin format was sent to BOB New York branch which in turn confirmed the balance by affixing a signature and Bank Seal on the format sent to them.\nIt was observed that the a fake Monthly Bank Statement was being prepared at the end of every month containing the desired debit credit entries which were additional to the daily statements.\nAccounts were drawn up on the basis of these Monthly Bank Statements and accordingly they reflected false balances.\nIt was observed that the Fixed Deposit Receipts FDRs were maintained in the office of the Chairman of Satyam Computers and taken from there by a single designated official of the accounts wing and handed over to another official of the wing who would in turn show them to the auditors as and when requested.\nFurther from the records of Satyam Computers as well as the books held with the auditors it was noted that two sets of letters of confirmation of balances of FDRs were available with the auditors a A confirmation received directly in the office of the auditors in the prescribed format.\nThis confirmation would state interalia the balances of all FDRs held by Satyam Computers with the respective bank as on a particular quarter ending date. b A confirmation from the bank received by Satyam Computers and addressed to the auditors but No in the prescribed format.\nThis confirmation would state in a single sentence the balances of FDRs held by Satyam Computers with the respective bank.\nFrom the confirmation letters of the banks as mentioned in para 29b above the following emerged a. in the confirmation letter of ICICI Bank dated October 4 2008 FDR number is No mentioned.\nThe name of customer is missing.\nThere is no reference to any letter of PW b. in the bank confirmation letter of HDFC Bank FDR number is No mentioned Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd c. in case of HSBC Bank office address from which the letter was issued is No mentioned d. the letterhead of HDFC is obviously No its own with the bank logo on the other side e. in the letter of BNP Paribas there is no reference to the letter of PW f. the letterheads were of an earlier period and persons who had signed the letters were No in the employment of the bank as on the date indicated on the letter g. the issuing of confirmation statements was undertaken by the branch which served as the primary relationship manager for Satyam Computers and that the branch indicated in the apparently forged letter does No send such confirmation letters.\nThe comparison between the two different set of FDR balances as on September 302008 is shown in the table below Name of the Bank Amount as per the books in ₹ crore Amount confirmed by banks in ₹ crore Citibank 613.32 1.32 HDFC Bank 704.16 NIL HSBC Bank 798.95 NIL ICICI Bank 725.30 NIL BNP Paribas 476.64 8.64 Total 3318.37 9.96 33.\nThe above data shows sharp contrast between the substantially large figures of FDR balances mentioned in the books of Satyam Computers and the actual FDR balance confirmed by the banks.\nAs per the books the FDR balances on the last day of each of the six quarters from June 30 2007 to September 30 2008 remained unchanged for three of the five banks HSBC HDFC and ICICI.\nThere was only a very marginal change for the other two banks i.e  Citibank and BNP Paribas.\nThe actual FDR balances along with the comparison with those stated in the books is shown in the following table Amount in ₹ crore Year ending 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 ICICI Bank  Deposit

received directly from the bank C difference between A and B i.e  the difference in balance figures.\n** Total of C = Total difference of balances with six banks.\nThe above table shows a continuous increase in differences in the FDR balances presented in the books as against the actual FDR balances reported by banks over the period 20012008.\nThe banks had further stated that the letters supposedly addressed to the auditors indicating the FDR balances of Satyam Computers had No been sent by them implying that the letters of the banks as available with the auditors were fake.\nIn view of the confirmation given by the banks about actual and true FDR balances of Satyam Computers it was observed that the balances of FDRs stated in the letters of confirmation in the prescribed format as mentioned in para 29a above tallied with the confirmation of FDR balances sent by the banks and reflected the complete and correct figures.\nHowever the FDR balances in the letters of confirmation received by Satyam Computers provided to the auditors as mentioned in para 29b above as shown in the books were substantially higher than the actual FDR balances and were nonexistent.\nOrder in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd 36.\nIt was further observed that the sales revenues were inflated and shown in the books through insertion of a large number of fictitious invoices raised in respect of fake customers and or transactions.\nThe fake invoices were introduced into the system through the Invoicing Management System “IMS”.\nThe IMS & other system tools of Satyam Computers 37.\nThe IMS was the tool used by Satyam Computers for generating the invoice to the Customer and is a downstream system for tools like OPTIMA SPR eSupport ONTIME PBMS etc.\nThe IMS absorbed the required data such as associate efforts project information etc. from these tools.\nThe six applications were integrated and data flowed from one application to the other and finally into the IMS for generation of invoices as briefly described below a OPTIMA Operational Real Time Project Management was the project management application of Satyam Computers.\nIt was used to create and maintain projects done by the organization.\nActivities such as creation of a project ID work breakdown structure including phases under the project and roles addition of projectspecific details such as start and end dates etc were done in this application. b SPR Satyam Project Repository was the project approval application of Satyam Computers.\nIt was used to approve projects which are newly created in OPTIMA or are modified in OPTIMA.\nApproval authorities at various levels approved or rejected the project in this application. c eSupport This application was used for the allocation of manpower and resources for projects. d ONTIME This was the effort management tool of Satyam Computers used to enable associates to capture their timesheets against the project IDs on which they were working so that the man hours for billing the customer could be calculated. e PBMS Project Billing Management System was the billing application of Satyam Computers used to bill the efforts entered in ONTIME and port the billed efforts to IMS for invoicing.\nA bill was generated with a unique serial number giving the details of the associates their man hours etc. called a partial bill.\nThe information from ONTIME flowed into this application for creation of this partial bill. f IMS was the application where the final invoice to be delivered to the customer was generated and imported the partial bill from PBMS.\nThe partial bill was consolidated in IMS and on the basis of the consolidated bill a final invoice was generated and sent to the customer. g The data from the IMS was ported into the Oracle Financials whereupon revenues are recorded in the books of account of Satyam Computers.\nThere was no automatic link or Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd integration between IMS and Oracle Financials; data was transmitted from one to the other manually by the user running appropriate programmes.\nThe generation of invoice in the normal course of business began with the inception of a project with a unique serial number and project ID OPTIMA.\nThe project was then passed for approval to the Finance in Charge and Associate in Charge SPR.\nAfter approval the requisite manpower and resources were allotted eSupport and the timecapturing mechanism ONTIME was activated for the purpose of billing the customer.\nAfter the ONTIME stage a partial bill was generated on the basis of the information fed on the ONTIME application PBMS.\nThereafter a final invoice for delivery to the customer was generated at the IMS stage.\nAt the IMS stage the information in the system up to the PBMS stage was integrated and consolidated and a consolidated bill was generated to be sent to the customer.\nAccess to all these stages was possible by using individual login IDs and passwords.\nApart from the above the system also enabled porting of data through MS Excel directly at the IMS stage.\nIn such a situation all the fields were entered in the IMS manually known as “excel porting”.\nWhen excel porting was done there was no need for the data to pass through all the stages mentioned above.\nIt was however necessary to have the Admin ID to generate invoices through excel porting.\nIn other words excel porting with the use of an Admin ID and password enabled the generation of an invoice directly at the IMS stage rather than the data being generated through the various other tools mentioned above.\nIt was observed that the Admin ID and password required for the onestep intervention through excel porting was with  Mr G. Ramakrishna and was made available to the Accounts Receivable team working under him which included  Mr Srisailam Chetkuru then Team Leader Satyam Computers who managed the invoicing team and at lower levels  Mr K. Malla Reddy then Executive Finance Satyam Computers and  Mr Suresh Kumar then Executive Finance Satyam Computers who were responsible for entering invoice data on the system.\nMr Malla Reddy had inter alia stated in his statement recorded on October 8 2009 that he used to receive an excel attachment from  Mr Srisailam Chetkuru who was his reporting manager and was instructed by him to hide the invoices mentioned in the attachment while updating collections in the IMS.\nAt the end of the month or midmonth he used to import excel files from a server folder into the IMS and generate invoices against the imported data.\nAfter he had raised the invoices which he had ported he used to hide them in the system.\nThese invoices were observed to be fake.\nHe had also stated that he used to receive the BoB New York branch statement on a daily basis and monthly basis.\nWhen they received the monthly statement they also used to receive an excel sheet which contained details of customer names invoice numbers credit amount which should be of the fake invoices.\nOn updating they used Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd to return the monthly statement and excel sheet to treasury.\nThis position was corroborated by the statement of  Mr P.B.V. Suresh Kumar then Executive Finance Satyam Computers.\nMr Suresh Kumar also stated that he used to prepare the excel file from which data was used to raise the fake invoices.\nCertain numbers were left out of the sequence in the Purchase Orders in the IMS data which he used to add to the excel file.\nHe would also take on a random basis the names of Associates role players approvers business heads etc. and add them to the excel file.\nMr Malla Reddy and  Mr Suresh Kumar had stated that about 300400 such fake invoices were generated each quarter resultantly showing inflated revenues in the books.\nMr V.V.K Raju the then Senior V.P.

Ramakrishna to whom he was reporting that  Mr Srinivas was asking him to make these changes whereupon  Mr Ramakrishna informed him that as the CFO was asking for these changes they should do it since he should know the rationale for the same.\nThe fake invoices mentioned above had been inserted into the IMS through the excel porting mechanism and that the revenues covered by those invoices in the books were fictitious.\nIn addition there were invoices in the IMS for the development of certain customized products in respect of nonexistent customers.\nThese invoices were tagged with the letter “H”.\nThere were a total of 27 such invoices as listed in the following table Sl No Invoice No Date of invoice Invoice Amount USD Name of customer 1.\nOFF06071859.\n31May06 3800000 AutoTech Service Inc 2.\nOFF06071900.\n31May06 3250000 AutoTech Service Inc 3.\nOFF060712733 26Oct06 1350000 Cellnet Inc 4.\nOFF06071946.\n31May06 2800000 Cellnet Inc 5.\nOFF06072135.\n31May06 2500000 Cellnet Inc 6.\nOFF06073860 30Jun06 1320000 Cellnet Inc 7.\nOFF06079204 31Aug06 1850000 Cellnet Inc 8.\nOFF060711765 30Sep06 2900000 eCare Inc 9.\nOFF06072038.\n31May06 2150000 eCare Inc 10.\nOFF06072170.\n31May06 1650000 eCare Inc 11.\nOFF06074229 30Jun06 1300000 eCare Inc 12.\nOFF06077050 31Jul06 1850000 eCare Inc 13.\nOFF06072044.\n31May06 3300000 Hargreaves Inc 14.\nOFF06075049 30Jun06 2050000 Hargreaves Inc 15.\nOFF06077099 31Jul06 1500000 Hargreaves Inc Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd 16.\nOFF06079323 31Aug06 2800000 Hargreaves Inc 17.\nOFF060712729 26Oct06 1780000 Mobitel Inc 18.\nOFF06071944.\n31May06 1825000 Mobitel Inc 19.\nOFF06072067.\n31May06 2325000 Mobitel Inc 20.\nOFF06074145 30Jun06 1750000 Mobitel Inc 21.\nOFF06077975 31Aug06 1960000 Mobitel Inc 22.\nOFF06072370.\n31May06 2150000 NorthSea Inc 23.\nOFF06074868 30Jun06 1750000 NorthSea Inc 24.\nOFF06072502.\n31May06 1850000 NorthSea Inc 25.\nOFF06076300 31Jul06 1550000 NorthSea Inc 26.\nOFF06071997.\n31May06 2750000 Synony Inc. 27.\nOFF06075425 30Jun06 2100000 Synony Inc.

R. Anand the concerned Business Head of Satyam Computers at the relevant time was asked to comment on a.\nThe authenticity of the invoices; b. whether the work was carried out on those invoices c. whether the same was delivered d. whether payment was received in those cases and e. the background behind these invoices.\nMr T. R. Anand in his response dated August 31 2009 had inter alia stated as follows a.\nOn April 9 2006 the MD  Mr Rama Raju had requested  MrAnand to propose some interesting product ideas that he could propose to product development companies.\nBased on the guidelines provided by  Mr Rama Raju  MrAnand sent  Mr Rama Raju a proposal under cover of an email dated April 18 2006 that covered conceiving designing and building a software product around Digital rights Management DRM that would help music and video companies to expand their offerings in the online space “DRM Rightsman” software product proposal.\nIn this regard  Mr Anand annexed inter alia emails dated April 9 2006 and April 18 2006 that were exchanged between him and  Mr Rama Raju.\nMr Rama Raju had stated in his email to  Mr Anand dated April 9 2006  “It is better that the team or others does No know that I am doing the introduction lest they may think that I may do the batting for them.\nYou may mark only the attachment for any of your team members but No this letter.”\nFurther  Mr Rama Raju emphasized that time was of the essence and that the proposal needs to be sent out before the evening of April 14 2006 i.e  in only five days Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd time.\nIt is also significant that the email from  Mr Rama Raju to  Mr Anand was within the knowledge of  Mr B. Ramalinga Raju as a copy of the same was marked to him. b.\nMr Rama Raju informed them that the proposal for “DRM Rights Man” product conception design build had been selected.\nMr Anand has annexed a copy of a purported Purchase Order of CellNet Inc. dated April 9 2009 in that regard.\nMr Anand then put together a development team that had 9 subteams.\nMr Anand‟s team developed the product using iterative mode each iteration producing an evolving version of the product. c.\nMr Anand received an email dated September 6 2006 from one Mr John V. Elite of M s Cellnet Inc in which  Mr Elite claimed to have approached Satyam Computers vide the abovementioned Purchase Order dated April 9 2009 for a project on DRM Rights Man and asked  Mr Anand to provide him a highlevel design and progress made in the deliverable packet as on date.\nMr Elite had also sent another email dated September 24 2006 enclosing his comments on the project being developed by  Mr Anand‟s team; details of which had been sent vide  Mr Anand‟s email dated September 11 2006.\nIt is significant to note that a copy of the email dated September 6 2006 was also marked to  Mr Rama Raju.\nMr Anand has further stated as follows i.\nThese invoices appear in the eIMS system; ii.\nHe has No received these invoices for submission to the customer No followed up with them for payments; iii.\nMr Rama Raju was directly dealing with this customer and iv.\nFrom the eIMS records it shows that payments have been received.\nIn order to find out about the existence of Cellnet Inc. for which the product was claimed to be developed by Satyam Computers a search was made on the internet which did No reveal the existence of any Cellnet Inc. at the aforesaid address.\nFurther there did No exist the website www.cellnetinc.net which has been given as the URL of Cellnet Inc. in the email of the so called  Mr John Elite.\nThus this customer was fictitious.\nIt was noted that the finance department was No able to get confirmations from the delivery personnel as to the delivery status of the product to Cellnet Inc.\nThus apart from the observation that the invoices generated were fake it was also observed that the invoices had obviously been raised to ramp up fake revenues in the books of Satyam Computers for the products so developed.\nWhen the authenticity of these invoices was questioned  Mr V.V.K. Raju confirmed that the customers mentioned in the said 27 invoices were fake.\nThus the customers mentioned in the above mentioned 27 were observed to be fake.\nFurther the invoices were visible to business heads and collections towards these invoices have been shown in the Oracle Financials.\nHowever as the http www.cellnetinc.net Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd business heads had neither received the invoices for submission to the customer No followed up for payment collections shown against such invoices in the Oracle Financials were clearly fictitious.\nMr Prabhakara Gupta has stated in his statement dated October 7 2009 that in the first quarter of 200708 data in the IMS was compared with that in the Oracle Financials by Internal Audit for the first time.\nThis was done while conducting internal audits in the cases of the clients viz.\nCitigroup Bear Stearns and Agilent.\nInternal Audit detected differences between the invoices reflected in the IMS as against those in the Oracle Financials.\nWhen these differences were reported to Finance Dept of Satyam Computers they replied to the Internal Audit that these differences were being reconciled and subsequently the Internal Audit team‟s access to the OFF module in Oracle Financials was also removed.\nIt was also stated by  Mr Prabhakara Gupta that  Mr Rama Raju had directed him to close the observations regarding the reconciliation of the invoices and told him that  Mr Ramakrishna would take care of the same.\nMr Ramakrishna told his team that reconciliation had been done in the Citigroup case and directed them to close the observations.\nThereafter he  Mr Prabhakara Gupta advised his team to close the observations in the Citigroup Report since he could No overrule the direction from  Mr Rama Raju.\nHe has stated that the same approach was taken for closure of the observation in the Agilent Report and that the Bear Stearns Report which as on the date of investigation was still open for compliance.\nMr Prabhakara Gupta had produced copies of the Internal Audit Reports in the cases of the three clients mentioned above.\nAll three Reports contained observations that there were invoices appearing in Oracle Financials which were No available in the IMS and stated that a reconciliation of the invoices in IMS and Oracle Financials should be performed.\nThe Report in the case of Citigroup Observation No 4 of the Internal Audit report stated that action had been taken in the form of reconciliation by Satyam Computers and contained a remark by Internal Audit that the observation had No been settled by Internal Audit .\nThe Bear Stearns Report Observation No 4 of the Internal Audit report stated that reconciliation was in progress and contained the Internal Audit remark “to check compliance on scheduled date”.\nThe Agilent Report Observation No 3 of the Internal Audit report stated that “the FIC is fully informed and will ensure that the reconciliation gets completed by end September 07” and contained the Internal Audit remark “Settled.\nTo be verified in future” and the target date was given as August 31 2008.\nThe invoices identified in the Internal Audit Reports were among the above mentioned 7561 fake invoices.\nAlthough Internal Audit had detected the mismatch between the invoices in the IMS and Oracle Financials as far back as in the first quarter of 200708 it closed these Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd observations and filed false reports to the effect that the observation had been settled and or that reconciliation would be verified in the future.\nIt is also important to note that the Internal Audit process was conducted by an internal team.\nThe consolidated statement of revenues

overstated to the extent of ₹ 4782.75 crores over a period of 56 years between 200304 and September 2008.\nAs mentioned hereinabove in his email dated January 7 2009  Mr Ramalinga Raju had stated that for the September 2008 quarter Satyam Computers had reported a revenue of ₹ 2700 crores and an operating margin of ₹ 649 crores 24% of revenues as against actual revenues of ₹ 2112 crores and an actual operating margin of ₹ 61 crores 3% of revenues.\nThe difference between the figures of ₹ 2700 crores and ₹ 2112 crores is ₹ 588 crores which tallies with the figure derived above for the same

with the 3% margin mentioned in  Mr Ramalinga Rajus email dated January 7 2009.\nThe inflation of Satyam Computers‟ sales revenues by the huge amount of at least ₹ 4782 crores had a direct impact on

have reported a loss as early as in the third quarter of the year 200708 itself and the EPS would actually have been negative in many quarters.\nEven where the revised EPS is a positive figure it is much lower than the published EPS based on the inflated earnings reflected in the books of account.\nThe effect of the inflated sales revenue on the EPS is graphically represented as follows 59.\nEPS P E etc are important factors for determining the value of a particular scrip and therefore has a direct bearing on the market price of the same.\nIn this case the falsified financials of the Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd company showed grossly inflated earnings which in turn were resulted in an inflated EPS that had a direct bearing on the investment decision of an investor.\nIt was also noted that the other financial ratios such as P E also portrayed an incorrect picture and the millions of investors who have invested in the scrip of Satyam Computers were clearly misled by the wrong projections given in the financial indicators such as EPS P E etc. If the actual financial status of Satyam Computers were made available to the public it would have immediately dampened the sentiment in the stock.\nIn this manner those who have indulged in the fraud and in portraying the false picture of Satyam Computers‟ finances to the investing public have No only misled and duped the investors but have also manipulated the price of the scrip by giving a false financial picture.\nAs stated in  Mr Ramalinga Raju‟s email dated January 07 2009 the figure of debtors of Satyam Computers shown in the books for the quarterended September 2008 was inflated by ₹ 490 crore.\nDuring investigations the inflated debtors figure for the quarter ended September 30 2008 and the earlier periods was observed as follows DETAILS OF DEBTORS INR FY QtrYear Published ‗s type invoices posted in Oracle Financials and appearing in debtors as outstanding Debtors after

Q42005 12266974917 1790995723 10475979193 61.\nFrom the above table it is seen that merely by taking into account the fictitious invoices and no other aspect of the manipulation of the books the overstatement of debtors was to the extent of ₹ 252.44 crore as at the end of March 31 2007 ₹ 571.12 crore as at the end of March 31 2008 and ₹ 500.20 crore as at the end of September 30 2008.\nIt was observed that the inflated receivables by creating fictitious invoices as aforesaid had resulted in fake debtors being created and shown in the books of Satyam Computers.\nAs per  Mr Ramalinga Rajus email dated January 7 2009 the balance sheet of Satyam Computers contained accrued interest of ₹ 376 crore which was nonexistent.\nAs mentioned hereinabove the fixed deposits to the extent of ₹ 3308.41 crore as on September 30 2008 were nonexistent and fictitious.\nSatyam Computers‟ books of account showed that it had earned a total accrued interest of ₹ 376 crore on those fictitious deposits as on September 30 2008.\nThus there was an overstatement of accrued interest to the tune of ₹ 376 crore as on September 30 2008.\nIt was further revealed that the accrued interest was overstated for earlier periods as well as described in the following table Period ended Published interest figures ₹ Actual interest figures ₹ Fictitious interest figures ₹ Mar03 184951538 1564674 183386864 Mar04 914594928 1092307 913502621 Mar05 244589297 931230 243658068 Mar06 1105925443 674594 1105250849 Mar07 648252916 2045718 646207198 Mar08 2724518164 1733109 2722785055 Jun08 3241112920 2064452 3239048468 Sep08 3763362204 2377099 3760985105 63.\nMr Ramalinga Raju in his email had stated that he had arranged for funds amounting to ₹1230 crore for Satyam Computers over the past two years which were No reflected in its books of account.\nOn January 8 2009 Satyam Computers received „identically worded letters‟ from 37 entities claiming that various amounts were paid to it and asking it to acknowledge the receipt of the outstanding amounts in books.\nThe total amount claimed to have been paid to Satyam Computers by these entities is ₹ 1425 crore.\nSince Satyam Computers‟ books did No reflect any Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd such receipts SEBI sought the details from its banks HDFC Bank HSBC and ICICI Bank in order to verify the same.\nIn addition the banks of the said 37 entities were also asked to forward copies of the cheques issued by them.\nOn analysis of the information received from the banks of Satyam Computers and the 37 entities it was observed that Satyam Computers had received the said amount of ₹1425 crore through cheques drawn on behalf of the said 37 entities on various dates in 2007 and 2008.\nHowever from the books of account of Satyam Computers and the statement of  Mr V.V.K. Raju it was noted that none of these receipts have been recorded in the Oracle Financials.\nIt was further observed that an amount of about ₹ 194.6 crore had been paid by Satyam Computers to various entities.\nThese payments were reflected in the Oracle Financials but shown as advances paid on behalf of Panchakalyani Agro Farms Pvt Ltd These cheques were signed by either  Mr Ramalinga Raju or  Mr Rama Raju.\nIt was  therefore observed that the amount of ₹ 1425 crores was received by Satyam Computers but was No reflected in its books and financial statements at all and an amount of about ₹ 194.6 crore was paid by Satyam Computers but recorded in the Oracle Financials in an incorrect and misleading manner.\nThe amount of net addition to TDS for the Assessment year 200809 financial year 200708 was ₹ 88.73 crores as per the books of account of Satyam Computers whereas the figure given in the audited balance sheet was ₹61.04 crores and the actual amount of TDS for which the benefit was claimed in the income tax return filed by Satyam Computers with the Income Tax Department for the same period was only ₹42.68 crores.\nSimilarly for the assessment year 200708 financial year 200607 the amount of net addition to TDS as per the books of account of Satyam Computers was ₹51.79 crore whereas the audited balance sheet showed a figure of ₹ 37.10 crores and the actual amount of TDS for which the benefit was claimed as per the income tax return was ₹16.63 crore.\nSimilar mismatches of TDS existed for earlier years as well.\nThus there were glaring mismatches in the various figures of TDS which were misleading.\nUnder clause 49 of the Listing Agreement the CEO i.e   Mr Rama Raju in this case and CFO i.e   Mr Vadlamani Srinivas in this case are required to provide periodic certification on various matters including that a the financial statements do No contain any materially untrue statement or omit any material fact or contain misleading statements; b the financial statements together present a true and fair view of Satyam Computers‟ affairs and are in compliance with existing accounting standards applicable laws and regulations; c there are no transactions entered into by Satyam Computers during the year which are fraudulent illegal or violative of Satyam Computers‟ code of conduct; d they accept responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal controls for financial reporting and have evaluated the effectiveness of internal control systems of Satyam Computers pertaining to financial reporting have disclosed Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd to the auditors and the Audit Committee deficiencies in the design or operation of such internal controls and the steps they have taken or propose to take to rectify these deficiencies; e they have indicated to the auditors and the Audit Committee instances of significant fraud of which they have become aware and the involvement therein if any of the management or an employee having a significant role in Satyam Computers‟ internal control system.\nIn this case both  Mr Rama Raju in his capacity as CEO of Satyam Computers and  Mr Srinivas in his capacity as the CFO of Satyam Computers have clearly given false certifications under the provisions of clause 49 of the Listing Agreement during the relevant period.\nBonus Issue of Satyam Computers 66.\nSatyam Computers made a bonus issue of 327694738 equity shares in the ratio of 11 to the shareholders in October 2006.\nThis bonus issue was made on the basis of the false financial position disclosed in the books of account and made available to the public at the time.\nThe financial position presented gave a grossly inflated and distorted picture of Satyam Computers‟ performance and finances.\nIn his statement dated February 6 2009 during investigation  Mr Ramalinga Raju stated that it was a decision which had no financial implication for Satyam Computers and at the same time was in line with the investors‟ expectations.\nHe also stated that among many demands that investors were making from time to time this was an easier decision for Satyam Computers to take under the circumstances.\nImmediately upon the announcement being made by Satyam Computers on April 10 2006 that it was considering the issue of bonus shares there was a rally in the scrip of Satyam Computers on the NSE the price rising from the previous closing price of ₹816.3 to a high of ₹844.5 about 3.5% before closing at ₹ 836.1 about 2.5%.\nSimilar upward movement was also noticed in the scrip at BSE.\nThus the bonus issue was No only deliberately made on the basis of a false and manipulated financial position but was declared with a view to mislead investors and to maintain an artificial price of the Satyam Computers share in the market.\nADS Issue of Satyam Computers 67.\nSatyam Computers had come out with a sponsored American Depository Share ADS issue in the year 2005 the draft prospectus of which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission USA on February 25 2005.\nMr Ramalinga Raju went ahead with this ADS issue although he knew that it was being made on a fraudulent and a false financial position.\nHe had stated during the investigation that he did No recollect the factors behind the justification of the issue and was unable to offer any additional comment.\nThe making of the ADS issue was another factor which boosted the image of Satyam Computers and its shares in the mind of the investors.\nThe prospectus contained detailed statements and financial information regarding the accounts and financial position of Satyam Computers.\nThis information and material based on which the ADS issue was made reflected the false and manipulated version of Satyam Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd Computers‟ finances in the books of account and its financial statements.\nTherefore a completely misleading picture of Satyam Computers‟ financial position and business was given in the prospectus as regards the ADS issuance.\nBuyback of shares of Satyam Computers 68.\nDuring December 2008 Satyam Computers announced that a proposal to buyback its shares would be considered at a Board Meeting to be held on December 29 2008.\nThis was after the failed attempt by Satyam Computers to proceed with the acquisition of Maytas Properties Ltd and Maytas Infra Ltd in December 2008.\nMr Ramalinga Raju initiated the announcement although he was aware No only that the financial position of Satyam Computers was being misrepresented but also the fact that it was in a financial crisis and was No even able to meet its regular payment obligations.\nMrRamalinga Raju in his statement stated that he was looking to gain additional time to sort out issues facing Satyam Computers at a board meeting and also that this was one of the things that was uppermost in the minds of the investors though Satyam Computers lacked the capacity to buyback the shares.\nData regarding price movement of the Satyam Computers share on December 18 2008 when the information regarding the buyback proposal was released to the press shows that the price of the Satyam Computers scrip in NSE rose from the previous closing price of ₹157.1 to ₹178.4 about 13.55% before closing at ₹ 169.5 about 7.89%.\nSimilar upward movement was noticed in the scrip price of Satyam Computers at BSE also.\nThe said announcement was clearly made with a view to portray a false picture in the market and to mislead investors.\nOther announcements of Satyam Computers 69.\nApart from the above  Mr Ramalinga Raju‟s statements make it clear that his intention was to maintain an artificial and false picture as to Satyam Computers‟ financials and the value of its shares in the market.\nHe has repeatedly referred to the operation of the market the valuation of Satyam Computers in the market investors‟ perceptions and expectations in his statements.\nFurther throughout the period in question Satyam Computers had published a quarterly Investor News Update called “Investorlink” in which various business and financial “highlights” and information regarding the performance of Satyam Computers was given.\nEach edition of the “Investorlink” contained a Chairman‟s address by  Mr Ramalinga Raju wherein he has made various false and misleading statements about the performance and financial position of Satyam Computers.\nThe Investorlink also contained false statements by various other officers of Satyam Computers most of which emphasized its purported excellent performance.\nThese were deliberate misstatements made to the investors with a view to deceive and dupe them.\nIn addition  Mr Ramalinga Raju  Mr Vadlamani Srinivas and others have made various public statements from time to time in various fora including press releases that were issued from time to time in which they have made various false and misleading statements as to Satyam Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd Computers‟ financial performance assets liabilities etc. To the extent that the issues announcements and releases mentioned above were intended to maintain an artificially high price of the Satyam Computers scrip in the market they have No only deceived investors by projecting fabricated financial position but also amounted to attempts to manipulate the price of the scrip.\nCHARGES UNDER PFUTP REGULATIONS ROLE OF RAMALINGA RAJU 70.\nIt was observed that  Mr Ramalinga Raju was the chief orchestrator of the fraud in this case.\nHis role also emerges from his own statements dated February 4 th  5 th and 6 th  2009.\nIn view of the above observations and findings of investigation it has been alleged that  Mr Ramalinga Raju was responsible for the entire exercise of misreporting financial performance fabrication and manipulation of the records of Satyam Computers and deliberately conveying a false picture of Satyam Computers‟ finances to the investing public and concerned authorities.\nThe monthly bank statements which were manipulated were sent by  Mr Ramalinga Raju‟s office directly to the concerned officials for the purpose of preparation of books of account of Satyam Computers.\nInstructions were also given to the concerned officers to the effect that they should take these statements into account while preparing the books of account.\nFurther the fabricated FDRs were found to have been kept by the Chairman‟s office and were only taken out of custody for verification by the Auditors.\nThere was a banking arrangement under which  Mr Ramalinga Raju and  Mr Rama Raju had direct access to the funds in the Bank of Bank of Baroda New York Branch.\nMr Ramakrishna in his statement recorded on January 13 2009 has stated that the monthly bank statements were received from the Chairman‟s office and that although differences were found between the daily and monthly statements the monthly statement was taken as the final statement for the purposes of accounting and reconciliation under the instructions of  Mr Ramalinga Raju.\nHe has also stated that he was informed of a banking arrangement at a meeting called by the Chairman at which  Mr Rama Raju  Mr Srinivas and  Mr Venkatapathy Raju were present.\nUnder this arrangement  Mr Ramalinga Raju and  Mr Rama Raju had access to the complete deposits and amounts in the BoB New York Branch account.\nBased on such access the Chairman‟s office procured monthly statements and sent them to the treasury.\nRelated communications regarding this account were also handled by the Chairman‟s office directly.\nFixed Deposits of a value of over ₹ 5 crores were also handled in a similar manner at the level of the Chairman‟s office.\nHe has also stated that the FDRs for the fixed deposits were kept in the Chairman‟s office and were brought personally by  Mr Venkatapathy Raju when the Auditors asked for them for verification.\nOrder in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd 73.\nMr Venkatapathy Raju has stated in his statement recorded on March 9 2009 that a he used to interact quarterly with the Ex Chairman of Satyam Computers  Mr Ramalinga Raju for taking the FDRs from  Mr Ramalinga Raju and returning them to him; b he noticed the differences between the daily and monthly statements in some accounts and informed  Mr Srinivas and  Mr Ramalinga Raju of this position whereupon they directed him to contact  Mr Ramakrishna; c he was instructed to prepare accounts on the basis of monthly statements by  Mr Ramalinga Raju  Mr Srinivas and  Mr Ramakrishna.\nHe was told by  Mr Ramalinga Raju that because of a special relationship with BoB New York branch there would be interbank transfers which he had to account for.\nThey used to receive an excel sheet along with the monthly statements from the Chairman‟s office on the basis of which he accounted for inter bank transfers; d At the end of a meeting about 68 years ago he was told that some high value fixed deposits would be taken care of by the Chairman and MD.\nFor accounting for these fixed deposits the FDRs had to be called for from the Chairman.\nMr Srinivas Vadlamani has stated in his statement recorded on February 20 2009 that a for fixed deposits and bank balances  Mr Ramakrishna‟s team used to be in direct touch with  Mr Ramalinga Raju and  Mr Rama Raju; b the entire exercise was coordinated orchestrated by  Mr Ramalinga Raju and  Mr Rama Raju in view of its complexity; c he did No inform the Audit Committee that monthly statements were taken as the final statements for accounting and reconciliation purposes under instructions from  Mr Ramalinga Raju; d when the Auditors asked for the FDRs for verification they were brought from the Chairman‟s office by  Mr Venkatapathy Raju.\nHe has also stated during his deposition on January 10 2009 that deployment of surplus funds was exclusively handled by  Mr Ramalinga Raju  Mr Rama Raju and that specific oral instructions were given to him by them that he should No interfere.\nOn January 21 2002 a resolution was passed by the Board of Directors of Satyam Computers authorising  Mr Ramalinga Raju and  Mr Rama Raju i.e  either of them to make any investment or place any fixed deposit from Satyam Computers‟ funds without any limit.\nThis resolution gave  Mr Ramalinga Raju and  Mr Rama Raju control over the alleged surplus funds of Satyam Computers and has clearly been misused by them inter alia through fictitious investments in fixed deposits.\nThe statements of the abovementioned persons and other material mentioned above clearly indicates  Mr Ramalinga Raju‟s involvement in the matter by keeping and sending the manipulated monthly bank statements issuing instructions for the use of monthly statements for accounting purposes directing that bogus interbank transfers be recorded on the basis of the excel sheet provided by his office keeping the forged

New York branch.\nInstructions to inflate revenues 77.\nMr Ramalinga Raju has himself admitted in his statements that he instructed  Mr Srinivas to „inflate performance‟ so that it was in line with “market expectations”.\nIn his statement dated February 20 2009  Mr Srinivas has stated that a  Mr Ramalinga Raju and  Mr Rama Raju used to have periodic interactions with  Mr Ramakrishna and himself during which both of them used to stress the importance of keeping Satyam Computers‟ performance in line with market expectations; b  Mr Ramalinga Raju and  Mr Rama Raju said that it was very important to show good results to attract customers employees etc and that they should show inflated results for a limited period of time; c Both  Mr Ramakrishna and he were No convinced of this argument and resisted the directions but they yielded to their pressure. d The practice was continued for quite some time perhaps to protect the share price.\nEven independently of the statement of  Mr Srinivas it is clear that  Mr Ramalinga Raju had directed and coordinated the inflation of revenues of Satyam Computers.\nThe announcements of bonus and buyback were clearly made with a view to deceive and mislead the investors as the actual fact that such announcements were made based on false and fabricated financial numbers were only known to Mr Ramalinga Raju and the other noticees and No to the unsuspecting investing public at large.\nA completely misleading picture of Satyam Computers‟ financial position and business was given in the prospectus as regards the ADS issuance.\nMr Ramalinga Raju went ahead with this ADS issue although he knew that it was being made on a fraudulent and a false financial position.\nROLE OF  Mr RAMA RAJU Orchestration and participation in the fraud 79.\nMr Rama Raju had contended that he did No know about the fraud in the affairs of Satyam Computers.\nHe also pleaded ignorance of various matters which fell within his scope of authority as Managing Director of Satyam Computers.\nHowever the material on record including the statements of  Mr Srinivas  Mr Ramakrishna  Mr Prabhakara Gupta and  Mr Venkatapathy Raju indicate  Mr Rama Rajus as well as  Mr Ramalinga Rajus active orchestration and involvement in the fraud in the areas including inflation of performance bogus fixed deposits and account balances accounting on the basis of manipulated monthly bank statements obstructing internal audit in order to ensure that fake invoices were No discovered and other matters.\nInflation of revenues creation and concealment of fake invoices Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd 80.\nIn his statement dated February 20 2009  Mr Srinivas had inter alia stated that a  Mr Ramalinga Raju and  Mr Rama Raju used to have periodic interactions with  Mr Ramakrishna and him during which both of them used to stress the importance of keeping Satyam Computers‟ performance in line with market expectations; b  Mr Ramalinga Raju and  Mr Rama Raju said that it was very important to show good results to attract customers employees etc. and that they should show inflated results for a limited period of time; c Both he and  Mr Ramakrishna were No convinced of this argument and resisted their directions but they yielded to their pressure; d The practice was continued for quite some time perhaps to protect the share price.\nThe email of  Mr T. R. Anand former business leader Satyam Computers has brought out the role of  Mr Rama Raju in the creation of certain “H” type invoices as stated in the paragraphs above.\nThe customers and the revenues covered by these invoices have been found to be fake and nonexistent.\nMr Rama Raju‟s involvement in this matter is also clear from the emails exchanged between him and  Mr Anand.\nIt was observed that  Mr Rama Raju had instructed  Mr T. R. Anand in his email dated April 9 2009 that no one else should know that he was doing the introduction and that he should mark only the attachment for any of his team members but No the letter.\nMr Rama Raju‟s stand that he was unaware of the bogus invoices inserted to inflate Satyam Computers‟ performance was observed to be in contradiction to  Mr Prabhakara Guptas statement dated October 7 2009.\nAs mentioned above  Mr Prabhakara Gupta has stated therein that Internal Audit had raised audit observations regarding the mismatch between the invoices in the IMS and the Oracle Financials during the course of internal audits in relation to the clients viz.\nCitigroup Bear Stearns and Agilent.\nHe was however directed by  Mr Rama Raju to close the observations pertaining to reconciliation and  Mr Rama Raju stated that  Mr Ramakrishna would take care of the same.\nThe access of the Internal Audit team to OFF module in the Oracle Financials was also removed after this episode.\nHe has stated that he could No overrule the directions from  Mr Rama Raju and therefore directed his team to close the observation.\nMr Prabhakara Gupta has also produced the Internal Audit Reports in question.\nMr Rama Raju‟s intervention and instructions to  Mr Prabhakara Gupta to close the audit observations were in order to ensure that the fake invoices which had been identified by Internal Audit were No exposed.\nIn view of the above observations  Mr Rama Raju was observed to be responsible along with  Mr Ramalinga Raju and others for the inflation of revenues in the published financials through the generation of fake invoices.\nOrder in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd Fixed deposits monthly statements banking arrangement & fake renewal letters 84.\nMr Rama Raju was authorized by the Board resolution dated January 21 2002 to make investments including placement of fixed deposits on behalf of Satyam Computers without any monetary limit.\nMr Srinivas had stated in his statement recorded on February 20 2009 that  Mr Ramakrishna‟s team used to be in touch with both  Mr Ramalinga Raju and  Mr Rama Raju with regard to fixed deposits and bank balances.\nHe also stated that the entire exercise was orchestrated by  Mr Ramalinga Raju and  Mr Rama Raju in view of its complexity.\nIn his statement recorded on January 10 2009  Mr Srinivas stated that deployment of surplus funds was exclusively handled by  Mr Ramalinga Raju  Mr Rama Raju and that specific oral instructions were given to him by them that he should No interfere.\nMr Ramakrishna stated in his statement recorded on March 9 2009 that he was instructed to prepare accounts on the basis of the monthly statements by  Mr Ramalinga Raju  Mr Rama Raju and  Mr Srinivas.\nHe also stated in his statement recorded on January 13 2009 that he was informed of a banking arrangement at a meeting called by the ExChairman of Satyam Computers at which  Mr Rama Raju  Mr Srinivas and  Mr Venkatapathy Raju were present.\nUnder this arrangement  Mr Ramalinga Raju and  Mr Rama Raju had access to the complete deposits and amounts in the BoB New York Branch account.\nBased on such access the Chairman‟s office procured monthly statements and sent them to the treasury.\nRelated communications regarding this account were also handled by the Chairman‟s office directly.\nFixed Deposits of a value of over ₹ 5 crores were also handled in a similar manner at the level of the Chairman‟s office.\nHe has also stated that the FDRs for the fixed deposits were kept in the Chairman‟s office and were brought personally by  Mr Venkatapathy Raju when the Auditors asked for them for verification.\nMr Venkatapathy Raju has also confirmed in his statement recorded on March 9 2009 that such a meeting was held and has stated that he was told at the meeting that some highvalue fixed deposits would be taken care of by the Chairman and the MD.\nFor accounting for these fixed deposits the FDRs had to be called for from the Chairman.\nIt was observed that  Mr Rama Raju generated letters requesting the creation or renewal of fictitious fixed deposits with banks so as to make such fixed deposits appear genuine.\nOne such instance brought out a letter dated October 26 2006 signed by  Mr Rama Raju as the MD addressed to HSBC stating that a wire transfer of ₹ 316.75 crores had been made to the bank on October 27 2006 and requesting that the amount be placed in fixed deposits of a fixed deposits along with a forged FDR of HSBC.\nThis fixed deposit is among the fictitious fixed deposits shown in the books of Satyam Computers.\nHSBC has also confirmed during a cross Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd verification done that it did No receive a wire transfer of any such amount and that the question of placing it in fixed deposits therefore did No arise.\nMr Rama Raju contended in his statements that he was No concerned with fixed deposits was unaware of the amounts kept in fixed deposits and had never seen the FDRs Mr Rama Raju also stated that he was No aware of any banking arrangement under which  Mr Ramalinga Raju and he had access to BoB New York Branch and of monthly bank statements going from the Chairman‟s office.\nHowever this is belied by the statements and other material mentioned above and is even otherwise No credible given his position and status in Satyam Computers at the relevant time.\nThe material on record clearly indicates  Mr Rama Raju‟s involvement in the fraud inter alia by issuing instructions for the use of monthly statements for accounting purposes taking control of fixed deposits ensuring that he and  Mr Ramalinga Raju retained control over the account at BoB New York branch issuing letters for renewal of fake fixed deposits and various other aspects of the fraud.\nTDS in income tax returns balance sheet & books of account 89.\nAs mentioned above glaring mismatches were observed in the figures of TDS in the books which were misleading to cover up the manipulation in the revenues.\nThe income tax returns and the audited balance sheets have been signed by  Mr Rama Raju in his capacity as Managing Director.\nApart from the fact that a grossly inflated figure of TDS has been shown in Satyam Computers‟ books of account  Mr Rama Raju has signed both the income tax return and the balance sheet in which different amounts of TDS were shown for the same year.\nPledge of shares by SRSR Holdings 90.\nMr Rama Raju has addressed a letter to the Company Secretary Satyam Computers dated December 27 2008 wherein he has stated that he wished to intimate that all the shares of Satyam Computers held by SRSR Holdings Pvt Ltd were pledged with institutional lenders over a period of time since September 2006.\nHe has further stated that it is possible that some of the lenders may exercise or may have exercised their option to liquidate shares to cover the margin shortfall and that this would dilute the promoter‟s holding in Satyam Computers.\nThis letter indicate that  Mr Rama Raju had knowledge of the pledge of shares and the purpose for which they were pledged as also that the lenders were going to enforce the pledge.\nHowever in his statement recorded on February 5 2009   Mr Rama Raju stated that a he was No aware why SRSR Holdings was formed; b he and  Mr Ramalinga Raju had transferred their shareholding in Satyam Computers to SRSR Holdings and were the owners of SRSR Holdings to the extent of the shares transferred; and c that he was aware that his shares had been pledged by SRSR Holdings but he had no idea as to what the money borrowed through the pledge was used for; d that he was aware of the margin calls from the lenders but No of the Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd time and persons entities who made the calls.\nFurther it is inconceivable that  Mr Rama Raju was unaware of the use of the funds raised by pledging the shares or the identity of the persons enforcing the pledge of those shares.\nKnowledge of payment of amounts brought into Satyam Computers 91.\nMr Ramakrishna was asked while recording his statement on January 13 2009 to offer his comments regarding the confession of  Mr Ramalinga Raju in his email dated January 7 2009.\nWith respect to paragraph 1c of the mail which stated that funds of ₹ 1230 crores had been arranged by  Mr Ramalinga Raju  Mr Ramakrishna stated that the payments were No recorded in the books of Satyam Computers.\nHe further stated that “on the oral advice of the Managing Director  Mr Rama Raju the same was accounted as advance given to various parties on behalf of an amount received from M s Panchakalyani Agro Farms P Ltd.”\nThis shows that  Mr Rama Raju No only had knowledge about the various payments that were being made but had instructed the finance personnel to record them in a certain manner.\nTherefore  Mr Rama Raju having complete knowledge of the payments made to Satyam Computers by the 37 entities is indisputable in view of the fact that he had himself signed many of the cheques repaying some of the amounts so brought into Satyam Computers.\nBonus & ADS Issues and buy back of shares by Satyam Computers 92.\nAs mentioned in pre paragraphs above bonus and ADS issues were made by Satyam Computers and a buyback of shares was announced all of which was on the basis of false and manipulated financial information.\nMr Rama Raju was aware of this position but along with  Mr Ramalinga Raju proceeded with these issues thereby misleading and duping investors in the market.\nAs far as buy back of shares is concerned in his statement recorded on February 6 2009  Mr Rama Raju had stated that  Mr Ramalinga Raju discussed the proposal with him and others and took the decision.\nMr Ramalinga Raju has himself made it clear that Satyam Computers lacked the capacity to make the buyback and that this announcement was only made to buy time and to satisfy investor expectation.\nFalse CEO certification under Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement 93.\nAs already mentioned in pre paragraphs above  Mr Rama Raju has from 2005 onwards signed the CEO certification in compliance with clause 49 of the Listing Agreement as the Managing Director of Satyam Computers.\nThe said certification was false and fraudulent to his knowledge.\nThe Listing Agreement and compliance therewith provide valuable assurances and comfort to the investing public and institutions that basic standards of corporate governance are followed by the listed companies.\nThe certifications given by the CEO under the provisions of the listing agreement have considerable bearing on the investors as they proceed on making the investment decisions on the basis of such a certification claiming genuineness and authenticity Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd of financial statements of Satyam Computers.\nIn providing the said false certification  Mr Rama Raju had deceived and duped No only the stock exchanges but also millions of investors.\nROLE OF  Mr VADLAMANI SRINIVAS Accounting on the basis of monthly bank statements & TDS 94.\nMr Ramakrishna had stated in his statements recorded on March 3rd and 9th 2009 that a he raised questions regarding nonreceipt of TDS certificates keeping money in current accounts and transactions appearing in the daily bank statements which were missing in the monthly bank statements with the CFO  Mr Srinivas.\nThe replies of  Mr Srinivas are stated to have ranged from “money being kept aside for acquisitions” to “do No bother senior management will take care of issues arising if any.” b  Mr Srinivas told him that they should No question the arrangement regarding additional entries in the monthly bank statements; c he passed on instructions to his subordinates to draft accounts on the basis of the monthly statements as these were the instructions from the Chairman Managing Director and CFO  Mr Srinivas; d he told his team to wait for receipt of TDS certificates as he was asked by  Mr Srinivas to wait and passed this on.\nSimilarly  Mr Venkatapathy Raju had stated in his statement recorded on March 9 2009 that a he had informed the CFO and the Chairman regarding the differences between the monthly and daily bank statements in INR bank accounts in 2002 and they directed him to contact  Mr Ramakrishna; b he was instructed to prepare accounts on the basis of monthly bank statements by the Chairman CFO and  Mr Ramakrishna and passed this on to his subordinates; c  Mr Ramakrishna and the CFO told him to wait for receipt of TDS certificates.\nAs mentioned above glaring mismatches were observed in the figures of TDS in the books which were misleading to cover up the manipulation in the revenues.\nSimilar mismatches of TDS were observed for earlier years as well in the books of Satyam Computers.\nThus it was observed that  Mr Srinivas was very much aware of the differences in these figures which were on account of the manipulation of the books and in fact attempted to conceal them.\nMIS Reports 97.\nAs stated above there were two sets of MIS for the same period within Satyam Computers – one set containing the true and correct figures and the other set containing fictitious sales added to the true numbers.\nIt was also revealed that the difference in the sales numbers tallies broadly with the amount generated by the fake invoices detected by SEBI.\nMr Ramarao Remella A.V.P Finance Satyam Computers had stated in his statement recorded on October 8 2009 that two sets of MIS were prepared containing the revenue Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd figures based on the directions given by  Mr Srinivas.\nHe was told by  Mr Srinivas that the change in the MIS from the IMS was necessary because  Mr Srinivas had “better information collected through review reports.”\nBonus & ADS Issues Buyback of shares by Satyam Computers 99.\nAs mentioned in pre paragraphs above bonus and ADS issues were made by Satyam Computers and a buyback of shares was announced all of which was on the basis of false and manipulated financial information.\nAs CFO and Head of Finance of Satyam Computers  Mr Srinivas was directly concerned with these issues and announcements.\nMr Srinivas proceeded with these issues and announcements although he was fully aware that they were being made on the basis of false and manipulated financials thereby misleading and duping millions of innocent investors in the market.\nFalse CFO certification under Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement 100.\nMr Srinivas had signed the CFO certification in compliance with clause 49 of the Listing Agreement as the CFO of Satyam Computers.\nThe said certification was false and fraudulent to his knowledge.\nThe Listing Agreement and compliances therewith provide valuable assurances and comfort to the investing public and institutions that basic standards of corporate governance are followed by listed companies.\nIt was revealed that by providing the said false certification  Mr Srinivas had deceived and misled No only the Stock Exchanges but also millions of investors.\nIt was observed that while  Mr Srinivas had already admitted his involvement in the fraud and manipulation of the books the abovementioned material further corroborated his role in the implementation of the same. 101.\nIn addition to above  Mr Ramalinga Raju  Mr Rama Raju and  Mr Vadlamani Srinivas had made various public statements from time to time in various fora including press releases that were issued from time to time in which they have made various false and misleading statements as to Satyam Computers‟ financial performance assets liabilities etc. To the extent that the issues announcements and releases were intended to maintain an artificially high price of the Satyam Computers scrip in the market they have No only deceived investors by projecting fabricated financial position but have also amounted to attempts to manipulate the price of the scrip.\nROLE OF  Mr G RAMAKRISHNA 102.\nMr G. Ramakrishna had admitted fraudulent practices such as accounting on the basis of monthly statements but had claimed that this was done on the instructions of  Mr Ramalinga Raju.\nIn his deposition he claimed that he did No have knowledge of the fraud and he was never suspicious about the accuracy of the financials.\nOn the basis of the admitted facts and other material on record including the statements of other officers of Satyam Computers it was Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd revealed that  Mr Ramakrishna was No only aware of the fraud but he also participated in the same. 103.\nMr Vadlamani Srinivas had stated in his statement recorded on February 20 2009 that  Mr Ramalinga Raju  Mr Rama Raju  Mr G.

Ramakrishna had stated in his statements on March 3rd and 9th 2009 that a he raised questions with  Mr Vadlamani Srinivas regarding nonreceipt of TDS certificates keeping money in current accounts and transactions appearing in the daily bank statements which were missing in the monthly bank statements.\nThe replies of  Mr Vadlamani Srinivas had ranged from “money being kept aside for acquisitions” to “do No bother senior management will take care of issues arising if any.”; b He gave his login ID to whoever asked him for it since the work of raising invoices could only be done with an admin log in; c He questioned  Mr Srinivas as to why entries in the daily statement were missing in the monthly statement whereupon  Mr Srinivas replied that since they had been told that this was an arrangement they should No question it.\nWhile this reply was unsatisfactory he did No pursue it; c Mr Ramakrishna mentioned that they were asked to stop all payments other than statutory and employee

Services Ltd stated that  Mr Ramakrishna told him to close the observations relating to reconciliation of invoices in IMS and Oracle Financials for the clients Citigroup Bear Stearns and Agilent and that  Mr Ramakrishna would take care of it.\nThereafter his team members were told by  Mr Ramakrishna that the reconciliation in the Citigroup and Agilent cases had been done and they were directed by  Mr Ramakrishna to close the observations in those cases.\nHe stated that the Bear Stearns Report was still open for compliance. 107.\nIt was also revealed that there were two sets of MIS for the same period within Satyam Computers – one set contained the true and correct figures and the other set contained fictitious sales numbers added to the true numbers.\nIt was also revealed that the difference in the sales numbers tallied broadly with the amount generated by the fake invoices .\nMr Ramarao Remella AVP Finance Satyam Computers had stated in his statement on October 8 2009 that based on the directions given by  Mr Srinivas two sets of MIS were prepared containing the revenue figures.\nHe was told by  Mr Srinivas that the change in the MIS from the IMS was necessary because  Mr Srinivas had “better information collected through review reports.”\nThe position regarding two different MIS reports was intimated to  Mr Ramakrishna who said that as the CFO was asking for it it should be done.\nHe had also stated that he enquired from  Mr Ramakrishna why there were two sets of bank statements and that  Mr Ramakrishna replied that there were subaccounts that for normal operations there would be visibility only of the subaccount and No the full account and that this was a normal business practice. 108.\nThe statements of  Mr Malla Reddy and  Mr Suresh Kumar of the Accounts Receivable “AR” team indicated that they used the admin ID and password to enter fake invoices through the mechanism of excel porting.\nThe admin ID and password were in possession of  Mr Ramakrishna and were shared with these persons.\nFurther the AR team was directly reporting to  Mr Ramakrishna. 109.\nAs mentioned in paragraphs above bonus and ADS issues were made by Satyam Computers and a buyback of shares was announced all of which was on the basis of false and manipulated financial information.\nMr Ramakrishna was No only aware that these issues and announcements were being made on the basis of false and manipulated financials but also permitted them to be made. 110.\nThe above facts and circumstances revealed that  Mr Ramakrishna had No only participated in the fraud but also had actively attempted to ensure that it did No come to light.\nOrder in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd ROLE OF  Mr PRABHAKARA GUPTA 111.\nMr Prabhakara Gupta initially stated in his statement dated January 16 2009 that he did No find any irregularities during the course of internal audit except some overinvoicing and under invoicing.\nSubsequently however in his statement dated October 7 2009 he stated that while conducting Internal Audits in the cases of the clients Citigroup Bear Stearns and Agilent Internal Audit had detected differences between the invoices reflected in the IMS as against those in the Oracle Financials.\nIt was revealed from the three Internal Audit Reports in question and the statements of  Mr Prabhakara Gupta that a.\nDuring the course of internal audit with regard to the clients Citigroup Bear Stearns and Agilent Internal Audit detected a mismatch between the invoices in the IMS and the Oracle Financials.\nThe invoices which were detected in Oracle Financials which were No appearing in the IMS were among the fake invoices inserted in the system to inflate performance. b.\nInternal Audit had raised observations in the three reports pertaining to these clients wherein it pointed out that it was necessary to carry out a reconciliation of the invoices in IMS with those in Oracle Financials. c.\nMr Rama Raju told  Mr Prabhakara Gupta to close the observations and stated that  Mr Ramakrishna would take care of this matter. d.\nInternal Audit‟s access to the OFF module in the Oracle Financials was removed. e.\nMr Ramakrishna told  Mr Prabhakara Gupta‟s team that reconciliation had been done and directed them to close the observation. f.\nMr Prabhakara Gupta instructed his team to close the observation.\nHe did so on the basis that he could No overrule the directions of  Mr Rama Raju. g.\nThe Report in the case of Citigroup Observation No 4 states that action has been taken in the form of a reconciliation by Satyam Computers and contains a remark by Internal Audit that the observation has No been settled by Internal Audit.\nThe Bear Stearns Report Observation No 4 states that reconciliation is in progress and contains the Internal Audit remark “to check compliance on scheduled date” the target date for compliance being August 31 2008.\nThe Agilent Report Observation No 3 states that “the FIC is fully informed and will ensure that the reco gets completed by end September 07” and contains the Internal Audit remark “Settled.\nTo be verified in future.” and the target date is given as August 31 2008. h.\nMr Prabhakara Gupta did No bring the fact that he had been prevailed upon to close the audit observations to the attention of the Audit Committee. 112.\nThe observations of Internal Audit were closed and false reports were filed to the effect that the observation had been settled or that reconciliation would be verified in the future.\nObviously Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd the verification which was supposed to be carried out later as per the reports was never carried out.\nIn short  Mr Prabhakara Gupta was either prevailed upon or chose of his own accord to close the examination of the mismatch of invoices.\nHe also did No bring the fact that he had been prevailed upon to close the observations to the attention of the Audit Committee though he was under a duty to do so.\nAs an Internal Auditor  Mr Prabhakara Gupta was under duty to probe further into the matter and independently act in the interest of investors.\nIf the reconciliation proposed by Internal Audit had been carried out the fake invoices would have been exposed.\nIt was observed that the closing of the observations was No only done with a view to ensure that the fake invoices were No detected but also was in breach of  Mr Prabhakara Gupta‟s basic duties as an Internal Auditor.\nThus  Mr Prabhakara Gupta was a participant or acquiesced in the fraud. 113.\nThe closure of the observations in the above cases was observed to be in clear breach of Satyam Computers‟ Internal Audit Manual.\nThe scope of Internal Audit under Chapter 3.0 Internal Audit Charter is “to determine whether the company‟s network of risk management control and governance processes as designed and represented by management is adequate and functioning in a manner to ensure inter alia that risks are appropriately identified and managed significant financial managerial and operating information is accurate reliable and timely and associates actions are in compliance with policies standards procedures and applicable laws and regulations.\nInternal Audit is accountable to the Audit Committee to provide assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the company‟s processes for controlling its activities and managing its risks in the areas set forth in the Annual Audit Plan and to report significant issues related to processes for controlling the activities of the company”.\nIt is specifically provided that Internal Audit shall be free from control or undue influence  in the selection and application of audit techniques procedures and programs.\n in the determination of facts revealed by the examination or in the development of recommendations or opinions as a result of the examination.\n in the selection of areas activities personal relationships and managerial policies to be examined.\nNo legitimate source of information is to be denied to the auditor. 114.\nInternal Audit has the responsibility under the manual inter alia to issue periodic reports to the Audit Committee and management summarizing results of audit activities to assist in the investigation of significant suspected fraudulent activities within Satyam Computers and notify the Audit Committee and management of the results to provide adequate follow up to make sure that appropriate and effective corrective action is taken.\nInternal Audit is authorized to have unrestricted free access to all functions records property and associates.\nIt is also provided that Internal Audit shall comply at a minimum with the relevant professional Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd standards such as the Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing and with professional standards of conduct such as the Code of Ethics of the Institute of Internal Auditors.\nUnder paragraph 7.9 a detailed procedure is laid down for preparation of draft audit reports and final reports and followup review.\nAll these provisions of the manual have No been followed in the abovementioned cases by  Mr Prabhakara Gupta and his Internal Audit team. 115.\nThe investigations observed that  Mr Prabhakara Gupta had No maintained an attitude of professional scepticism recognizing the possibility that a material misstatement due to fraud could exist as required under SA 200 AAS 1 issued by the ICAI.\nIt was also observed that  Mr Prabhakara Gupta had mentioned in his statement dated January 16 2009 that an Internal Audit of bank balances was conducted but that was restricted to samples of operational bank accounts.\nThe audited balances did No include the audited balances of BoB New York branch although the current account with BoB New York branch held as much as 75% of all the current account balances of Satyam Computers and was therefore of obvious materiality.\nSuch specific and selective exclusion is a clear indication of  Mr Prabhakara Gupta‟s involvement in the fraud. 116.\nAs mentioned above the figure of net addition to the TDS for the Assessment year 200809 financial year 200708 was ₹ 88.73 crores as per the books of account of Satyam Computers ₹ 61.04 crores as per the audited balance sheet and ₹ 42.68 crores as per its income tax return.\nSimilarly for the assessment year 200708 financial year 200607 the figure of net addition to the TDS was ₹ 51.79 crore as per the books of account of Satyam Computers ₹ 37.10 crores as per the audited balance sheet and ₹16.63 crore as per the income tax return.\nSimilar mismatches of TDS existed in the books for earlier years also.\nThe glaring differences in the figures would have aroused the suspicion of any internal auditor and ought to have been probed and brought to the attention of the Audit Committee. 117.\nBonus and ADS issues were made by Satyam Computers and a buyback of shares was announced all of which were on the basis of false and manipulated financial information.\nMr Prabhakara Gupta who was the Head of Internal Audit was aware that these issues and announcements were being made on the basis of false and manipulated financials thereby played his role in No only misleading and duping investors in the market but permitted them to be made. 118.\nThe facts and circumstances observed in this case confirm that  Mr Prabhakara Gupta had chosen to ignore the facts which were glaring indicators of fraud being perpetrated and that he was involved in the entire fraud.\nOrder in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd CHARGE WITH RESPECT TO INSIDER TRADING 119.\nIt is undisputed fact that the price of the scrip closed at a low of ₹ 41.05 on January 07 2009 from ₹ 178.95 on the previous days price on NSE after the news regarding financial irregularities in Satyam Computers was made public.\nThis also shows that the information about about the adverse financial position of Satyam Computers and the fudged financial numbers was price sensitive.\nWhile in possession of the unpublished price sensitive information some of the noticees sold transferred and pledged the shares of Satyam Computers at high prices and benefited substantially at the cost of other unsuspecting investors in the market as detailed in the following paragraphs.\nMr RAMALINGA RAJU AND  Mr RAMA RAJU 120.\nMr Ramalinga Raju and  Mr Rama Raju had sold substantial shares in the market or made off market transfers to other entities during the period January 2001 to December 2008 when in possession of the unpublished price sensitive information about the adverse financial position of Satyam Computers and the fudged financial numbers which only they were privy

spite of several opportunities afforded to them by SEBI.\nThe details of such opportunities have been given on earlier pages of this order.\nI am passing this order considering the facts mentioned in the SCNs in the letters submitted by the noticees on various occasions and the material available on record.\nI do No find any material to differ from the findings of investigations as alleged in the SCNs.\nFrom the material available on record I find that the noticees individually as well as acting in concert falsified the books of account and mis stated financials of Satyam Computers and thus portrayed a false picture of its published quarterly annual results.\nThey also provided false CEO CFO certification made various announcements and issued advertisements press releases on the basis of falsified and mis stated financial position of the company.\nThe noticees also indulged in insider trading on the basis of unpublished price sensitive information  UPSI .\nSuch instances include the following Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd a prepared fake monthly bank statements of the Satyam Computers Current Account with BoB New York Branch to the extent of around ₹1732 crore and also created fake and non existent FDRs of Satyam Computers to the extent of around ₹3308 crore as on September 30 2008 with various banks.\nThey also dishonestly showed fake interest accrued to the extent of around ₹376 crore as on September 30 2008 in the balance sheet of Satyam Computers.\nThis was done with an intent to portray healthier bank balances than the actual ones in the accounts of Satyam Computers. b inflated sales of Satyam Computers by creating fictitious sales invoices in the names of actual customers and also in the names of fake customers.\nThey also inflated the figures of debtors of Satyam Computers by around ₹ 500 crore as on September 30 2008.\nThus the revenues were overstated and the liabilities were under stated in the books of account of the company.\nIn this way they overstated Satyam Computers‟ revenues to the extent of ₹ 4782.75 crore till September 30 2008.\nIt is evident that though the actual net worth of Satyam Computers was a much eroded figure the noticees dishonestly and in a deceitful manner overstated financial results of Satyam Computers. c misstated the books of account by No including receipts to the extent of ₹1425 crore and payments of ₹195 crores in the books of account of Satyam Computers.\nThus the books of account did No reflect the actual debt position of the company. d created glaring mismatches in the figures of TDS in the books which were misleading to cover up the manipulation in the revenues. e provided false CEO CFO certification of the truth and fairness compliance with existing accounting standards of the financial statements nonexistence of fraudulent transactions operation design of internal controls etc. as part of whole strategy of disclosing the false financial position of Satyam Computers and actively concealing the true financials. f made announcements of bonus shares buyback and ADS issues as well as other public announcements from time to time including by way of press releases on the basis of a false and manipulated financial position and portrayed a false picture of the financial position of the company with a view to mislead deceive investors and to manipulate and artificially maintain the price of the scrip of Satyam Computers in the market.\nOrder in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd g indulged in sale and pledge of shares of Satyam Computers while in possession of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information UPSI about its adverse financial position and made unlawful gains. 133.\nAs described in the SCNs in order to achieve the above objectives several illegal and unethical methodologies were used such as preparing fabricated and faked Monthly Bank Statements fabricated and faked letters from banks indicating the FDR balances; fraudulently entering data by excel porting and generating fake invoices for delivery to the fictitious customers forging the books of account and financial statements etc. 134.\nIn the facts and circumstances as described in the SCNs I find that the noticees who were in charge of affairs of Satyam Computers at the relevant times colluded and connived with each other in actively inflating the revenues and understating the liabilities of Satyam Computers by manipulation and fabrication of the books of account and financial statements and falsification of the information presented in the same.\nThe financial statements prepared or caused to be prepared by them did No contain true and fair disclosures of the financial position of Satyam Computers.\nThe noticees thus deliberately projected a grossly false picture of the financials of Satyam Computers to millions of investors.\nIn my view the deliberate false statements misrepresentations of the material facts and active suppression and concealment of material facts as found in this case amount to suppressio veri and suggestio falsi which a facet of fraud as defined in regulation 21 c of the PFUTP Regulations. 135.\nIt goes without saying that the financial position and networth of a listed company have direct bearing on its share price and trading behaviour of investors in its scrip apart from impacting the reputation of the company.\nThus they have potential to influence investment decisions of the investors in the scrip of the company.\nConsidering the facts and circumstances described in the SCNs I am of the view that by creating and certifying the false and overstated financial results over the years as true and fair the noticees have misled the investors of Satyam Computers.\nThe acts and omissions of the noticees as found in this case were in my view clearly a device scheme and artifice employed by the noticees to defraud in connection with dealing in securities of Satyam Computers and fall in the ambit of prohibited activities under section 12Aa b c of the SEBI Act and regulation 3bc and d and regulation 41 and 42aefk and r of the PFUTP Regulations. 136.\nI further find that advertisements carrying the quarterly financial results of Satyam Computers were also misleading and they contained spurious information.\nSuch publications of false and misleading financial results created artificial demand in the scrip of Satyam Computers and also led to false and misleading price discovery of its securities in the stock market.\nThis clearly has Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd influenced the decisions of numerous investors and induced them to trade in the securities of Satyam Computers.\nI also find that in this case the announcements of bonus shares ADS and buy back of shares concealing the true and fair financial position and disclosing manipulated and falsified financial position of Satyam Computers had clearly the potential to influence the investment decisions of investors and induce them to acquire or dispose of shares ADS of Satyam Computers.\nFurther the noticees have periodically made statements from time to time in various press releases etc. in which they have made various false and misleading statements as to Satyam Computers‟ financial performance assets liabilities etc.\nIn my view such fraudulent or deceptive device scheme act or practice having the potential to induce sale or purchase of or dealing in securities or to influence the investment decisions of the investors are squarely covered by the prohibitions of section 12A b and c of the SEBI Act and regulation 3c and d of the PFUTP Regulations.\nIn this regard it would be worthwhile to refer to the following observations made by the Hon‟ble SAT in matter of V. Natarajan vs  SEBI Order dated June 29 2011 in Appeal No 104 of 2011 “… we are satisfied that the provisions of Regulations 3 and 4 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market Regulations 2003 were violated.\nThese regulations among others prohibit any person from employing any device scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on an exchange.\nThey also prohibit persons from engaging in any act practice and course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities that are listed on stock exchanges.\nThese regulations also prohibit persons from indulging in a fraudulent or unfair trade practice in securities which includes publishing any information which is No true or which he does No believe to be true.\nAny advertisement that is misleading or contains information in a distorted manner which may influence the decision of the investors is also an unfair trade practice in securities which is prohibited.\nThe regulations also make it clear that planting false or misleading news which may induce the public for selling or purchasing securities would also come within the ambit of unfair trade practice in securities.. 137.\nI therefore find that all the noticees have employed a device to deceive and defraud the investors in violation of section 12Aa b c of the SEBI Act and regulation 3bc and d and regulation 41 and 42aefk and r of the PFUTP Regulations. 138.\nIt is trite to say that the periodical financial results of Satyam Computers were price sensitive information as defined in regulation 2ha of the PIT Regulations.\nThe actual financial results remained within knowledge and possession of the noticees but the false and misleading financial results were published.\nThus the price sensitive information about true and correct financial Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd results remained unpublished within the definition under regulation 2k.\nThe information about actual periodical financial results of Satyam Computers therefore remained unpublished price sensitive information UPSI during the relevant time.\nMr Ramalinga Raju and  Mr Rama Raju being the Chairman and Managing Director respectively of Satyam Computers at the relevant times were insiders within meaning of the term under regulation 2 e read with definition of the expression connected person under regulation 2c i of the PIT Regulations.\nMr Vadlamani Srinivas  Mr G Ramakrishna and  Mr V. S. Prabhakara Gupta being the CFO VP Finance and Head Internal Auditor of Satyam Computers respectively were actively involved in manipulation of books of account and misstating of the financials of Satyam Computers as described in the SCNs.\nAs such they had access to the UPSI and were in possession thereof at the relevant time.\nAccordingly they were insiders within the meaning of the term under regulation 2 eii of the PIT Regulations.\nApart from this being officers employees of Satyam Computers having access to UPSI relating to Satyam Computers they were connected persons within the meaning of this expression in regulations 2cii of the PIT Regulations.\nI therefore find that all the noticees in this case were insiders in possession of the UPSI at the relevant times. 139.\nAs described in the SCNs regarding charges of insider trading and as discussed hereinabove the noticees being in possession of the UPSI sold and pledged in the garb of loan transaction the shares of Satyam Computer to derive gain on the basis of the same.\nThey took advantage of the high valuation which had been given to Satyam Computers by the market as the same was No aware of the true financial position of the company.\nI therefore find that the noticees have also violated the provisions of section 12A d and e of the SEBI Act and regulations 3 and 4 of the PIT Regulations. 140.\nIt is noted that on account of their fraudulent acts omissions and illegal transactions  Mr Ramalinga Raju  Mr Rama Raju  Mr Vadlamani Srinivas  Mr G Ramakrishna and  Mr V. S. Prabhakara Gupta have made unlawful gains as follows Sr.\nNo Name of the noticee Amount ₹ Mode of transaction a  Mr Ramalinga Raju and  Mr Rama Raju 543.93 crores Sale of shares 1258.88 crores Pledge of shares b  Mr Vadlamani Srinivas 29.5 crores Sale of shares c  Mr G Ramakrishna 11.5 crores Sale of shares d  Mr V S Prabhakara Gupta 512.65 lac.\nSale of shares 141.\nIt is to be kept in mind that financial statements are the yardstick that numerous stakeholders use to assess the financial health of a company.\nFalsified financial statements may lead to wrong Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd assessments and flawed investment decisions.\nFurther the persons in charge of affairs of management of a company are entrusted with fiduciary duty to act in the interest of the shareholders as such they are trustees of the shareholders‟ interests.\nThese persons particularly those holding the position of Chairman Managing Director CEO CFO etc. as in this case have access to almost all confidential data and information relating to the company and are in position to exploit this access to the detriment of the investors yet the investors repose faith in them and trust that they will work in their best interest.\nIf the financial and securities related frauds are perpetrated by such persons it would breach the trust and deal a huge blow to the confidence of No only the investors stakeholders of the relevant company but also the whole market.\nSuch incidences have ripple effect and adversely affect the sentiment and the confidence of the whole securities market.\nIn the facts and circumstances as discussed hereinabove it is noted that the fraudulent acts and omissions of the noticees in a coordinated manner have shattered the confidence of millions of genuine and unsuspecting investors in securities of Satyam Computers and caused serious prejudice to integrity of the securities market. 142.\nI note that the aforesaid acts omissions and conduct of the noticees as described in the respective SCNs and the consequences thereof also raise serious concerns about the non observance of the principles of corporate governance in this case.\nThe true fair adequate and timely disclosures of the financial position of a company form one of the basic tenets of governance in listed companies and are essential for maintaining the integrity of the securities market.\nIn this case the noticees apart from above contraventions have failed to observe their fiduciary duties and have violated the principles of corporate governance in general and the obligation of CEO CFO certification stipulated in clause 49 of the Listing Agreement in particular. 143.\nIn the present case the noticees have committed a sophisticated white collar financial fraud with premeditated and well thought of plan and deliberate design for personal gains and to the detriment of the company and investors in its securities.\nIn this regard I deem it fit to mention the judgement of Honble Supreme Court of India in the matter Ram Narayan Popli Vs CBI Appeal Crl. 1097 of 1999 wherein it observed as follows The Cause of the community deserves better treatment at the hand of the court in the discharge of its judicial functions.\nThe community or the state is No a persona No grata whose cause may be treated with disdain.\nThe entire community is aggrieved if economic offenders who ruin the economy of the state are No brought to book.\nA murder may be committed in the heat of moment upon passions being aroused.\nAn economic offence is committed with cool calculation and deliberate design with an eye on personal profit regardless of the consequence to the community.\nA disregard for the interest of the Community can be manifested only at the cost of forfeiting the trust and faith of the community in the system to administer justice in an even handed manner without fear Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd of criticism from the quarters which view white collar crimes with permissive eye unmindful of the damage; done to the National Economy and National Interest as was aptly stated in State of Gujrat V. Mohanlal Jitamalji Porwal and Anr.\nAIR 1987 1321.\nUnfortunately in the last few years the country has seen an alarming rise in white collar crimes which has affected the fibre of the countrys economic structure.\nThese case are nothing but private gain at the cost of public and lead to economic disaster. 144.\nGiven the vital function of protecting investors and safeguarding the integrity of the securities market vested in SEBI and the commensurate powers given to it under the securities laws it is necessary for SEBI to exercise these powers firmly and effectively to insulate the market and its investors from the fraudulent actions of the participants in the securities market.\nOne of the basic premises that underlines the integrity of securities market is that the participants conform to standards of transparency good governance and ethical behaviour prescribed in securities laws and do No resort to manipulative deceptive and fraudulent activities.\nIn this case the acts omissions and conduct of the noticees as brought out in the SCNs have been in violation of this basic premise.\nThe financial frauds as found in this case are inimical to the interests of the investors in securities and endanger the market integrity.\nI am convinced that this is a case where befitting enforcement action is necessary to send a stern message to the market to create an effective deterrence. 145.\nIt is also worth mentioning that recently the Honble Supreme Court in the matter of N. Narayanan Vs.\nAdjudicating Officer SEBI Civil appeal nos. 41124113 of 2013 D.\nNo 201 of 2013 made the following observation with a word of caution to SEBI word of caution SEBI the market regulator has to deal sternly with companies and their Directors indulging in manipulative and deceptive devices insider trading etc. or else they will be failing in their duty to promote orderly and healthy growth of the Securities market.\nEconomic offence people of this country should know is a serious crime which if No properly dealt with as it should be will affect No only country‟s economic growth but also slow the inflow of foreign investment by genuine investors and also casts a slur on India‟s securities market.\nMessage should go that our country will No tolerate “market abuse” and that we are governed by the “Rule of Law”.\nFraud deceit artificiality SEBI should ensure have no place in the securities market of this country and „market security‟ is our motto.\nPeople with power and money and in management of the companies unfortunately often command more respect in our society than the subscribers and investors in their companies.\nCompanies are thriving with investors‟ contributions but they are a divided lot.\nSEBI has therefore a duty to protect investors individual and collective against opportunistic behaviour of Directors and Insiders of the listed companies so as to safeguard market‟s integrity. 146.\nConsidering the above I in order to protect the interest of investors and the integrity of the securities market in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under section 19 of the SEBI Act 1992 read with section 11 114 and 11B of the SEBI Act and regulation 11 of SEBI Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to the Securities Market Order in the matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd Regulations 2003 and regulation 11 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 hereby restrain the following persons from accessing the securities market and further prohibit them from buying selling or otherwise dealing in securities directly or indirectly or being associated with the securities market in any manner whatsoever for a period of 14 years  S.\nNo Name PAN 1  Mr B Ramalinga Raju ExChairman Satyam Computer Services Limited.\nACVPB8311J 2  Mr B Rama Raju ExManaging Director Satyam Computer Services Limited.\nACEPB2813Q 3  Mr Vadlamani Srinivas ExChief Financial Officer Satyam Computer Services Limited.\nABEPV4019P 4  Mr G Ramakrishna ExVice President Finance Satyam Computer Services Limited.\nACAPG1654L 5  Mr VS Prabhakara Gupta ExHead Internal Audit Satyam Computer Services Limited.\nAEAPP2815G 147.\nAs described in the SCNs on account of their illegal transactions the noticees have made unlawful gains as mentioned in para. 140 of this order.\nI am of the view that no person can be allowed unjust enrichment by way of wrongful gain made on account of fraudulent manipulative and unfair activities and or insider trading as found hereinabove.\nI therefore in exercise of the powers conferred under section 11 and 11B of the SEBI Act 1992 read with Securities Laws Amendment Ordinance 2014 direct the noticees to disgorge the wrongful gain made by them from their contraventions as described in para 140 of this order with simple interest @ 12% per annum from January 07 2009 till the date of payment.\nThey shall pay the said amounts within 45 forty five days from the date of this order by way of demand draft drawn in favour of “Securities and Exchange Board of India” payable at Mumbai. 148.\nThis Order shall come into force with immediate effect.\nCopies of this Order shall also be served upon the depositories and stock exchanges for necessary action on their part.\nDate  JULY 15 th  2014 RAJEEV KUMAR AGARWAL Place Mumbai WHOLE TIME MEMBER SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA", "No Name PAN Order No 1  Mr B Ramalinga Raju ExChairman Satyam Computer Services Limited ACVPB8311J 64 2014 2  Mr B Rama Raju ExManaging Director Satyam Computer Services Limited ACEPB2813Q 65 2014 3  Mr Vadlamani Srinivas ExChief Financial Officer  Satyam Computer Services Limited ABEPV4019P 66 2014 4  Mr G Ramakrishna ExVice President Finance Satyam Computer Services Limited ACAPG1654L 67 2014 5  Mr VS Prabhakara Gupta ExHead Internal Audit Satyam Computer Services Limited AEAPP2815G 68 2014 1."))

Company were listed on NSE and the Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd BSE.\nThe investigations prima facie revealed that there was a delay by the Company in disseminating price sensitive information to the stock exchanges and that the promoters and the Company related entities had benefited by purchasing shares of the Company prior to dissemination of price sensitive information to public.\nFurther despite being clearly stated in its code of conduct for prevention of insider trading that trading window shall be closed 4days prior to its Board Meeting in connection with certain events it has failed to close the trading window prior to its Board Meetings which were held for the purpose of issuing of convertible warrants ADR GDR etc.\nIt was also observed that some of the Company related

notice dated July 19 2011.\nIn reply to the said notice of hearing the Noticee vide letter dated July 30 2011 requested for an adjournment of the hearing to any date after August 20 2011.\nConsidering the said request another opportunity of hearing was granted to the Noticee on August 24 2011 which was attended by the Noticee and  Mr Vinay Chauhan Advocate.\nAt the time of the hearing the Noticee also submitted his additional written submissions dated August 24 2011 alongwith the annual report of the Company for the year 200809.\nOral submissions made by the Noticee were recorded.\nPursuant to the hearing the Noticee filed his further written submissions dated August 27 2011 and furnished details of VEL shares purchased by him and his mother during August 2009 to April 2010.\nThe Company received the work order from the Government of Arunachal Pradesh only on August 24 2009.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 8.\nI have carefully perused the details of the allegations made against the Noticee material available on record and the oral and written submissions made by the Noticee.\nThe main issue that arises here is as to whether the Noticee was in possession of any unpublished price sensitive information and whether he communicated such unpublished price sensitive information to his family members mother who thereafter purchased the shares of the Company and made unlawful gains.\nIf yes then whether such acts of the Noticee are in violation of the provisions of regulation 3 i and or 3 ii of the PIT Regulations.\nIt is undisputed fact that the Noticee was the Chairman of the Company during the relevant period and had presided over the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company that was held on July 31 2009.\nIt is evident from point No 20 of the minutes of the said meeting that the matter regarding getting of projects from the Government of Arunachal Pradesh was discussed in the said meeting wherein  Mr Suresh Mansata Commercial Manager of the Company was authorized to execute and sign the Contract Agreement and bank guarantees for the said projects.\nFurther I have noted from the documents on record that the letter towards their getting of project subject to their compliance with certain conditions was issued to the Company by the Government of Arunachal Pradesh on July 31 2009.\nThe Noticee has claimed that the same was received by the Company only on August 03 2009.\nHere I would like to point out that since the said acceptance letter to the Company was issued on July 31 2009 it means that the decision regarding acceptance of the Company’s proposal bid for the project was taken by the Government of Arunachal Pradesh either on July 31 2009 or a date prior to July 31 2009.\nSURESH MANSATA TO SIGN AND EXECUTE CONTRACT AT ARUNACHAL PRADESH

work order was issued by the Government of Arunachal Pradesh on August 22 2009 which was received by the Company on August 24 2009.\nI have perused the material on record and observed that copy of two such letters of Public Works Department of Government of Arunachal Pradesh are available which are respectively confirming about award of projects worth around 42 crore and 36 crore to the Company.\nThe Noticee has stated that these letters were issued on August 22 2009 and received at the Company’s end on August 24 2009.\nI have observed that on both the said letters date is appearing at two places.\nIn both the said letters date is mentioned by the person signing the letter as 22 08 09 below his signature but in both the letters there is overwriting which suggests that some other number in the date was initially mentioned and has subsequently been changed as 22.\nNow the point to be noted here is that corporate announcement regarding the aforesaid price sensitive information was made by the Company on August 28 2009 at 64845 p.m.\nThe Noticee who was earlier No holding even a single share of the Company allegedly made the following purchases before the said corporate announcement was made by the Company on August 28 2009  Client Date Period BSE NSE Bought Sold Bought Sold Anil Harish the Noticee August 21 2009 Prior to announcement August 28 2009 of getting a project worth 172 cr. 9600 0 10400 0 August 25 2009 9960 0 10040 0 13.\nFurther it has also been noted that Mrs. Ratna Harish mother of the Noticee who was also No holding even a single share earlier allegedly made the following purchases before the said corporate announcement made by the Company on August 28 2009 – Client Date Period BSE NSE Bought Sold Bought Sold Ratna Harish mother of the Noticee August 25 2009 Prior to announcement August 28 2009 of getting a project worth 172 cr. 3701 0 5500 0 14.\nIn regard to the said purchases by himself and his mother the Noticee has stated that the Indian economy was doing well and particularly since infrastructure was being emphasized by the Government he felt that the Company had a good longterm future and therefore decided to invest in the shares of the Company.\nBut all the investments were made after the date of AGM i.e  August 20 2009 and further that in the said AGM of the Company that was held on August 20 2009 the shareholders were informed that the Company had orders of about 1000 crore on hand.\nThe said purchases by the Noticee and his mother just few days prior to the Company making corporate announcement regarding its getting of projects from the Government of Arunachal Pradesh become more suspicious on the count that earlier they were No holding any shares of the Company and in last so many years they had No purchased even a single share of the Company.\nThe Noticee has further stated that before they started purchasing the shares on August 21 25 2009 in the AGM of the Company that was held on August 20 2009 the shareholders were informed that the Company had orders of about 1000 crore on hand.\nFurther I have perused the copy of corresponding speech of the Chairman made before the shareholders of the Company in the AGM on August 20 2009 and observed that there is no mention of the Arunachal Pradesh Project.\nThat means that the investors shareholders and public at large came to know about the Company bagging the project only after the corporate announcement was made by VEL in this regard on August 28 2009.\nThe Noticee has stated that if he wished to take advantage of the unpublished price sensitive information then he would have purchased the shares immediately after the Board meeting on July 31 2009 rather than to wait for three weeks until after the AGM.\nOn this issue I have noted from the Noticee’s own submissions that the letter dated July 31 2009 of the Government of Arunachal Pradesh was only a “Letter of Acceptance” and getting of final Work Order was subject to compliance of certain conditions.\nIn this regard I had advised the Noticee at the time of personal hearing to furnish all sale purchases made by him and his mother during the calendar year 2009 i.e  January to December 2009.\nThereafter for the next four months the Noticee did No make any purchases.\nIn January 2010 he purchased a few shares 144 shares and then again after a gap of around four months he purchased some more shares towards end of April 2010. ii Ratna Harish  mother of the Noticee  Date of Purchase No of shares Rate per share in  25.08.2009 9201 87.27 28.08.2009 10000 76.00 04.01.2010 789 109.95 15.04.2010 10000 198.69 Total  29990 It is evident from the above that just like the Noticee his mother Ratna Harish was also No holding any shares of the Company earlier but all of a sudden she started making purchases with effect from August 25 2009 and major purchases i.e  purchase of 19 201 shares were made by her prior to the public announcement made by the Company on August 28 2009.\nHer entire purchase of 19201 shares made in the year 2009 were just prior to the corporate announcement made by the Company on the evening of August 28 2009.\nIt is also evident from the above details that except for the first purchase made by the Noticee on August 21 2009 the subsequent purchases made by him and his mother prior to the corporate announcement made by VEL are on the same dates viz.\nFirst the corporate announcement made by the Company regarding its bagging of projects worth 172 crore was a significant corporate development and therefore it was indeed a price sensitive information in terms of regulation 2haiv of the PIT Regulations which was disseminated by the Company to the public on the evening of August 28 2009.\nDespite that the Noticee and his mother purchased the shares before the information was disseminated to public.\nI have noted that after August 28 2009 neither the Noticee No his mother had purchased any VEL shares for the next four months.\nThe said purchase of 79 378 shares by the Noticee and 19201 shares by his mother made immediately prior to August 28 2009 are the only purchases made by them during the entire 2009.\nIt had moved almost in tandem with the BSE Sensex as has been detailed below  Date Closing price   Sensex 27.08.2009 84.65 15781.05 28.08.2009 Friday 93.10 15922.34 31.08.2009 Monday 91.10 15666.64 01.09.2009 86.45 15551.19 The above details suggest that after the corporate announcement was made on August 28 2009 there was subsequent fall in BSE Sensex and the price of the shares have also come down.\nThe Noticee has further purchased some shares of the Company on 04.01.2010 and thereafter on 27.04.2010 respectively @ 109.70 and 208.09 per share.\nThe Noticee has stated that the highest price of the shares in August 2009 was 93.10 and there was no impact whatsoever on prices which have remained at the same level for the last four months.\nI have noted that the price movement in the shares of the Company as has been detailed in the table at para No 20 above do indicate that during the last week of August 2009 its price had moved almost in tandem with the BSE Sensex and the corporate disclosure made by the Company on August 28 2009 regarding its getting orders worth 172 crore from the Government of Arunachal Pradesh had no significant impact on the price of the scrip.\nThe Noticee being an insider as he was the Chairman of the Company during the relevant period and as has been discussed above was in possession of some unpublished price sensitive information and he along with his mother who were earlier No holding any shares of the Company made purchases during August 21 2009 to August 28 2009 in large numbers.\nThe average price of the shares purchased by the Noticee up to August 28 2009 comes out to approximately 78.53 per share\nDuring the said period the Noticee being in possession of the price sensitive information was prohibited under law [regulation 3 i of the PIT Regulations] to deal in the shares of the Company.\nAverage closing price of the shares for the week after August 28 2009 was approximately 87.20.\nThus even if the average closing price of the shares for the next one week after the date of corporate announcement is considered I am of the view that by No complying with the requirements prescribed under regulation 3 i of the PIT Regulations the Noticee has benefitted to the extent of 8.67  87.20  78.53 per share i.e  he has made unlawful gains of approximately 6.88 lakh [i.e  8.67 * 79378].\nThe provisions of section 15 G of the SEBI Act are reproduced hereunder – 15G.\n– If any insider who i either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person deals in securities of a body corporate listed on any stock exchange on the basis of any unpublished price sensitive information; or ii communicates any unpublished price sensitive information to any person with or without his request for such information except as required in the ordinary course of business or under any law; or iii counsels or procures for any other person to deal in any securities of any body corporate on the basis of unpublished pricesensitive information shall be liable to a penalty of twentyfive crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of insider trading whichever is higher.\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15 G of the SEBI Act it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15 J of the SEBI Act which are as under 15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nHowever from the above estimates roughly the figures for the undue gains made by the Noticee comes out to around 6.88 lakh.\nTherefore considering all the facts and circumstances of the case I am of the opinion that a penalty of 20.00 lakh on the Noticee which is around three times the undue gains made by him shall be commensurate with the violations committed .\nIn exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15 I of the Act and rule 4 of the Rules I impose penalty of 2000000  Rupees twenty lakh only on the Noticee in terms of the provisions of section 15 G of the SEBI Act for the violation of the aforesaid provisions of the PIT Regulations.\nThe Noticee shall pay the said amount of penalty by way of demand draft in favour of “SEBI  Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai within 45 days of receipt of this order.\nThe said demand draft should be forwarded to The Deputy General Manager IVD – ID4 Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI Bhavan Plot No.C4A “G” Block Bandra Kurla Complex Bandra East Mumbai–400 051.\nIn terms of the provisions of rule 6 of the Rules copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.\nDate October 31 2011 SATYA RANJAN PRASAD Place MUMBAI ADJUDICATING OFFICER", "The provisions of section 15 G of the SEBI Act are reproduced hereunder – 15G."))

the personal hearing on November 23 2020 and reiterated the submissions made by the Noticees in their respective replies dated November 06 2020.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 9.\nI have taken into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case and the material available on record the issues that arise for consideration in the present case are a Whether the Noticees have violated the provisions of Regulation 292 read with Regulation 293 of the SAST Regulations? b Does the violation if any attract monetary penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act? c If so what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act?\nBefore moving forward it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of the SAST Regulations which read as under SAST Regulations 2011 292 Any person who together with persons acting in concert with him holds shares or voting rights entitling them to five percent or more of the shares or voting rights in a target company shall disclose the number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights even if such change results in shareholding falling below five percent if there has been change in such holdings from the last disclosure made under subregulation or under this subregulation; and such change exceeds two per cent of total shareholding or voting rights in the target company in such form as may be specified.\n3 The disclosures required under subregulation 1 and sub regulation 2 shall be made within two working days of the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares or the acquisition of shares or voting rights in the target company to – a Every stock exchange where the shares of the target company are listed; and b the target company at its registered office.\nTherefore it is relevant to discuss the definition of PACs as given in Regulation 21q of SAST Regulations q “persons acting in concert” means— 1 persons who with a common objective or purpose of acquisition of shares or voting rights in or exercising control over a target company pursuant to an agreement or understanding formal or informal directly or indirectly cooperate for acquisition of shares or voting rights in or exercise of control over the target company.\n2 Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing the persons falling within the following categories shall be deemed to be persons acting in concert with other persons within the same category unless the contrary is established — i a company its holding company subsidiary company and any company under the same management or control; ii a company its directors and any person entrusted with the management of the company; iii directors of companies referred to in item i and ii of this

per cent of the paidup capital of that investment company or unit capital of that fund Provided that nothing contained in this subclause shall apply to holding of units of mutual funds registered with

partnership firm in which such person or his immediate relative is a partner; and d members of Hindu undivided families of which such person is a coparcener;\nI further note from the letters dated March 18 19 and April 09 2019 of the Noticees submitted in reply to the letter dated March 11 2019 of SEBI that the Noticees have No raised any such issue in the said letter.\nI further note from the trading pattern of the Noticees that they were holding shares of ATCL at least from January 01 2017.\nThereafter suddenly all of them started selling their respective shares from March 17 2017 and they had completely sold their respective holdings on or before March 30 2017.\nIt was observed from the Demat statements of the Noticees that each of the Noticees were holding 250000 shares of ATCL at the start of relevant period in their respective Demat Accounts.\nThus the Noticees were together allegedly holding 1500000 shares of ATCL which amounts to 12.06% of total shareholding of the Company.\nThereafter the Noticees had entered into the following transactions in the scrip of ATCL during the relevant period Name of the Noticee Date of sale No of shares sold Shareholding post transactions Shareholding post transactions in % terms Shareholding of the Noticees as on 01.01.2017 1500000 12.06% Kiritbhai Nathubhai Vaghani 17.03.2017 13000 1400000 11.25% Vipulkumar Nathubhai

29.03.2017 5400 263700 2.12% Rekhaben Jitubhai Vaghani 94600 Kiritbhai Nathubhai Vaghani 30.03.2017 83600 113700 0.91% Jitubhai Nathubhai Vaghani 66400 17.\nFrom the above table I note that as on March 16 2017 the Noticees were cumulatively holding 12.06% of total shareholding of ATCL.\nThereafter they started selling shares of ATCL starting from March 17 2017.\nDuring the period March 17 2017 to March 30 2017 the Noticees had sold most of their shareholding of ATCL.\nI further note from the above table that the Noticees sold a total of 1386300 shares of ATCL and as a result the cumulative shareholding of the Noticees in ATCL had decreased to 113700 shares i.e  0.91% of total shareholding of the Company.\nWith the sale of 300000 shares by the Noticees on March 20 2017 out of the said 1386300 shares sold by the Noticees the cumulative shareholding of the Noticees had reduced by more than 2% from their cumulative shareholding on March 16 2017 and consequently the Noticees were obligated to make necessary disclosure to BSE and ATCL as stipulated under Regulation 292 read with Regulation 293 of the SAST Regulations.\nSimilarly the cumulative shareholding of the Noticees was again reduced by more than 2% on March 22 2017 and March 28 2017 when they sold 274000 shares and 100000 shares respectively on the abovementioned dates.\nI note from available records that no disclosure from the Noticees under Regulation 292 of SAST Regulations is available on BSE website.\nTherefore irrespective of the fact as to whether the shares were purchased from open market or shares were received on account of amalgamation or by way of bonus shares if as a result of such acquisition receipt percentage of shares held by that person exceeds the limits prescribed under the respective regulations then it is mandatory to make disclosures under those regulations.”\nIn view of the same I am convinced that it is a fit case for imposition of monetary penalty on the Noticees under the provisions of Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act which reads as under Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder— b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less 25.\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act it is important to consider the factors relevantly as stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act which reads as under Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer.\nWhile adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nAfter taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case material facts on record and also the factors mentioned in the preceding paragraphs I in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules hereby impose the following penalty on the Noticees under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act for the failure on their part to comply with the relevant provisions of law.\nName of the Noticee Penalty Kiritbhai Nathubhai Vaghani Rs 100000  Rupees One Lakh only Vipulkumar Nathubhai Vaghani Rs 100000  Rupees One Lakh only Jitubhai Nathubhai Vaghani Rs 100000  Rupees One Lakh only Ashmitaben Kiritbhai Vaghani Rs 100000  Rupees One Lakh only Ritaben Vipulbhai Vaghani Rs 100000  Rupees One Lakh only Rekhaben Jitubhai Vaghani Rs 100000  Rupees One Lakh only I am of the view that the said penalty is commensurate with the lapse omission on the part of theNoticees28.\nThe Noticee shall remit pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order through Demand Draft in favour of “SEBI Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai or the online payment facility available on the website of SEBI i.e  www.sebi.gov.in on the following path by clicking on the payment link ENFORCEMENT > Orders > Orders of AO > PAY NOW.\nIn case of any difficulties in payment of penalties the Noticee may contact the support at portalhelp@sebi.gov.in. 29.\nThe Noticee shall forward said Demand Draft or the details confirmation of penalty so paid to the Enforcement Department of SEBI.\nThe Noticee shall provide the following details while forwarding DD payment information a Name and PAN of the entity Noticee b Name of the case matter c Purpose of Payment –Payment of penalty under AO proceedings d Bank Name and Account Number e Transaction Number 30.\nIn the event of failure to pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of the receipt of this Order recovery proceedings may be initiated under Section 28A of the SEBI Act for realization of the said amount of penalty along with interest thereon inter alia by attachment and sale of movable and immovable properties.\nIn terms of the provisions of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules a copy of this order is being sent to the Noticees viz.\nKiritbhai Nathubhai Vaghani Vipulkumar Nathubhai Vaghani Jitubhai Nathubhai Vaghani Ashmitaben Kiritbhai Vaghani Ritaben Vipulbhai Vaghani Rekhaben Jitubhai Vaghani and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.", "2[Explanation.—For the removal of doubts it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E clauses b and c of section 15F 15G 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.]"))

for the purpose of monthly closing of the bank ledger and preparation of monthly bank reconciliation statement.\nIt was also observed that certain transactions in the Daily Bank Statement were No

was prepared and balances as per the books were filled in.\nIt was observed that the a fake Monthly Bank Statement was being prepared at the end of every month containing the desired debit credit entries which were additional to the daily statements.\nFurther from the records of Satyam Computers as well as the books held with the auditors it was noted that two sets of letters of confirmation of balances of FDRs were available with the auditors a A confirmation received directly in the office of the auditors in the prescribed format.\nThe comparison between the two different set of FDR

balances presented in the books as against the actual FDR balances reported by banks over the period 20012008.\nThe banks had further stated that the letters supposedly addressed to the auditors indicating the FDR balances of Satyam Computers had No been sent by them implying that the letters of the banks as available with the auditors were fake.\nIn view of the confirmation given by the banks about actual and true FDR balances of Satyam Computers it was observed that the balances of FDRs stated in the letters of confirmation in the prescribed format as mentioned in para 29a above

the 37 entities it was observed that Satyam Computers had received the said amount of ₹1425 crore through cheques drawn on behalf of the said 37 entities on various dates in 2007 and 2008.\nHowever from the books of account of Satyam Computers and the statement of  Mr V.V.K.

some highvalue fixed deposits would be taken care of by the Chairman and the MD.\nIt was observed that  Mr Rama Raju generated letters requesting the creation or renewal of fictitious fixed deposits with banks so as to make such fixed deposits appear genuine.\nOne such instance brought out a letter dated October 26 2006 signed by  Mr Rama Raju as the MD addressed to HSBC stating that a wire transfer of ₹ 316.75 crores had been made to the bank on October 27 2006 and requesting that the amount be placed in fixed deposits of a fixed deposits along with a forged FDR of HSBC.\nThe material

instructed the finance personnel to record them in a certain manner.\nBonus & ADS Issues and buy back of shares by Satyam Computers 92.\nAs already mentioned in pre paragraphs above  Mr Rama Raju has

appearing for the hearing vide fax dated January 20 2010 requested for extension of hearing till end of January 2010.\nAccordingly the hearing was fixed for February 10 2010 and Mr Sandip Mistry Authorized Representative hereinafter referred to as “AR” appeared on behalf of the Noticee on the said date and reiterated the submissions made vide letter dated February 05 2010 as follows i.\nShe

present case are  a Whether the Noticee had violated regulation 3 a & d regulation 41 42a of FUTP Regulations read with section 12A c of SEBI Act? b Whether the Noticee had violated regulation 3i of PIT Regulations read with section 12 A d & e of the SEBI Act? c Does the violation if any on the part of the Noticee attract monetary penalty under section 15 HA and 15G i of SEBI Act? d If so what

shall directly or indirectly a buy sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; d engage in any act practice course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.\nRegulation 41 no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities.\nRegulation 42 Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves fraud and may include all or any of the following namely a indulging in an act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market;\nINSIDER TRADING REGULATIONS 1992 Regulation 3 Prohibition on dealing communicating or counselling on matters relating to insider trading No insider shall— i either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person deal in securities of a company listed on any stock exchange when in possession of any unpublished price sensitive information;\nNo person shall directly or indirectly – c engage in any act practice course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with the issue dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made d engage in insider trading e deal in securities while in possession of material or nonpublic information or communicate such material or nonpublic information to any other person in a manner which is in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;\nI have taken into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case the submissions made by the noticee and the material available on the record.\nOn perusal of the documents available on record as well as the submissions made by the Noticee I find that the NPL made major corporate announcements on 6 days during the period January 23 2006 to March 08 2006.\nThese announcements were related to quarterly financial results Bonus issue and expansion plan.\nI note from the SCN that except for announcement on an expansion plan all other announcements were implemented by NPL.\nI also note that the price of the scrip after the above announcement went up from Rs 102.50 on February 20 2006 to Rs 146.85 on March 8 2006.\nIt is noted from the SCN that the NPL incurred a loss of Rs 5.23 crore as on 31st March 2006 whereas the sum total of the unaudited figures for the quarter ending June to March 2006 showed a profit of Rs 1.38 crore.\nFrom the trade and order log it is observed that the 25 PACs including the Noticee offloaded 1015433 shares which was12.80% of the traded volume on the exchanges NSE and BSE and 7.52% of total capital in the market after the positive announcements related to expansion plan were made by the company.\nThe PACs who sold the shares were the family members and group companies of the Chairman  Mr Vedprakash Chiripal and Managing Director  Mr Shyam Gupta.\nI note from the SCN as well as from the noticee’s submission that she had sold 45700 shares on February 27 2006 against its holding of 45800 shares as on March 31 2005.\nI note that the PACs held 35.31% of the total capital of NPL as on March 31 2005 and the noticee held 0.96% of the PACs’ holding.\nI also note that the noticee’s sale of 45700 shares constitutes 4.5% of the total shares sold by the PACs during the investigation period.\nI note from the material available on record that there is no allegation about the noticee’s involvement in any of these misleading announcements or resultant price rise in the scrip of NPL.\nIn fact I note from the investigation report that the noticee has dealt in the scrip after NPL made misleading announcements which influenced the price and the volume.\nI note that Regulations 3a and 3d of FUTP prohibits a person to deal in securities in a fraudulent manner and engage in any act practice course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person respectively with regard to ‘issue’ ‘purchase’ or ‘sale’ of any security listed or proposed to be listed at a recognized stock exchange.\nFurther Regulation 41 and 42 prohibit persons from indulging in fraudulent or unfair trade practices while dealing in securities.\nBefore dealing with the issue as to whether the noticee violated the provisions of regulation 3i of PIT Regulations I note the definition of insider and price sensitive information under PIT Regulations as follows Regulation 2e “insider” means any person who is or was connected with the company or is deemed to have been connected with the company and is reasonably expected to have access to unpublished price sensitive information in respect of securities of company or has received or has had access to such unpublished price sensitive information.\nRegulation 2c “connected person” means any person who i “is a director as defined in clause 13 of section 2 of the Companies Act 1956 1 of 1956 of a company or is deemed to be a director of that company by virtue of subclause 10 of section 307 of that Act” Regulation 2h “person is deemed to be a connected person” if such person— i is a company under the same management or group or any subsidiary company thereof within the meaning of sub section 1B of section 370 or subsection 11 of section 372 of the Companies Act 1956 1 of 1956 or subclause g of section 2 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1969 54 of 1969 as the case may be; viii relatives of the connected person Regulation 2ha “price sensitive information” means any information which relates directly or in directly to a company and which if published is likely to materially affect the price of securities of company.\nExplanation—The following shall be deemed to be price sensitive information— i periodical financial results of the company; ii intended declaration of dividends both interim and final; iii issue of securities or buyback of securities; iv any major expansion plans or execution of new projects.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Urmiladevi J Agarwal in the matter of M s Nova Petrochemicals Ltd June 29 2010 v amalgamation mergers or takeovers; vi disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking; vii and significant changes in policies plans or operations of the company;\nI note that the information related to financial results and expansion plan falls within the definition of price sensitive information as defined in the Regulation 2 of PIT Regulations.\nThis is also evident form the fact that when the price of the scrip after the above misleading announcements went up from Rs 102.50 on February 20 2006 to Rs 146.85 on March 8 2006 the noticee who is related to Mr Ved Prakash Chiripal the Chairman of NPL sold 45700 shares on February 27 2006 and continues to hold only 100 shares.\nThus the violation of sections 12A d&e of SEBI Act and regulation 3 i of PIT Regulations by the Noticee makes her liable for penalty under section 15G i of the SEBI Act1992.which read as follows 15G.Penalty for insider trading  If any insider who i either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person deals in securities of a body corporate listed on any stock exchange on the basis of any unpublished price sensitive information 29.\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under section 15 G i it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under “15J Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nAfter taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case and on a judicious exercise of the powers conferred upon me I hereby impose a monetary penalty of Rs 50000  Rupees Fifty Thousand only on Smt.\nUrmiladevi J Agarwal shall pay the said amount of penalty by way of demand draft in favour of “SEBI  Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai within 45 days of receipt of this order.\nThe said demand draft should be forwarded to Shri Ali Asgar Mithwani Deputy General Manager Investigations Department  Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI Bhavan Plot No.C4A “G” Block Bandra Kurla Complex Bandra East Mumbai–400 051.\nIn terms of rule 6 of the Rules copies of this order are sent to Smt.\nUrmiladevi J Agarwal

Whether Salputri had failed to disclose the change in its holdings as alleged in the SCN?\nB. If yes does the violation if any on the part of Salputri attract monetary penalty under Section 15A b of SEBI Act? mailtosalputri.comm@gmail.com mailtosalputri.comm@gmail.com Adjudication Order against Salputri Commerce P Ltd in the matter of Falcon Tyres Ltd C. If yes what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed on Salputri taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act?\nISSUE A Whether Salputri had failed to disclose the change in its holdings as alleged in the SCN?\nFalcon on April 26 2012 had allotted a total of 43387048 equity shares of Falcon on a preferential basis to three entities including Salputri against an outstanding loan of Rs 1440449995 .\nSalputri was allotted 13016114 shares which is 16.80% of the share capital of Falcon.\nThe intimation with respect to allotment of shares of Falcon was received by Salputri on April 28 2012.\nIt is pertinent to note that in terms of Regulation 131 read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations Salputri was required to disclose the said acquisition of 16.80% of share capital of Falcon within two working days of the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares.\nHowever it was observed that Salputri had disclosed the said acquisition of shares to Falcon on June 17 2015 in turn the Falcon made the required disclosure under Regulation 136 of PIT Regulations to BSE.\nThus a delay of more than 3 years is observed from the date of receipt of intimation of allotment of shares by Salpturi.\nIt is an admitted fact that Salputri has made delayed disclosure with respect to the change in its holdings.\nIt is also observed for the said acquisition Salputri had made disclosure in terms of SEBI Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations 2011 within the time of two working days from the date of the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares.\nIssue B Does the violation if any attract monetary penalty under Section 15A b of SEBI Act?\nAdjudication Order against Salputri Commerce P Ltd in the matter of Falcon Tyres Ltd 16.\nIn view of the above conclusion drawn it No remains to be determined whether the violation attracts the monetary penalty under section 15Ab of the SEBI Act.\nIn this regards the provisions of Section 15Ab is quoted as follows “Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder— b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty which shall No be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees;”\nHon’ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of Chairman SEBI v.\nShriram Mutual Fund {[2006] 5 SCC 361} wherein it was held that In our view the penalty is attracted as soon as contravention of the statutory obligations as contemplated by the Act is established and therefore the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes immaterial.\n………. Hence we are of the view that once the contravention is established then the penalty has to follow and only the quantum of penalty is discretionary.\nBased on the above present case is a fit case for imposing penalty upon Salputri under Section 15Ab of SEBI Act for violation of Regulation 131 read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations {to be read with Regulation 122 of SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 2015}.\nIssue C what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act?\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under section 15Aa it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under “15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.”\nAdjudication Order against Salputri Commerce P Ltd in the matter of Falcon Tyres Ltd 1[Explanation.—For the removal of doubts it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E clauses b and c of section 15F 15G 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.]\nThe material made available on record has No quantified the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticee and the loss suffered by the investors due to such violations and No has such allegations been made against Salputri.\nMaterial information on records do No suggest that the act of the noticee is repetitive in nature.\nThe factors set out the in the Order of the Honble Securities Appellate Tribunal in Ashok Jain V.

Nova Petrochemicals Ltd June 29 2010 MD sold together 1015443 shares through Religare and SP Jain Securities which accounted for 12.80% of the traded volume both BSE and NSE during January 23 2006 to March31 2006 before the outcome of the negative results and thereby alleged to have violated Regulation 3 a & d Regulation 41 42a of FUTP Regulations read with Section 12Ac of SEBI Act 1992 and regulation 3i of PIT Regulations read with Section 12Ad & e of SEBI Act 1992.\nI note that the provisions of law alleged to have been violated by the noticee read as follows FUTP REGULATIONS 2003 Regulation 3.\nProhibition of Certain Dealings in Securities No person shall directly or indirectly a buy sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; d engage in any act practice course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.\nRegulation 41 no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities.\nRegulation 42 Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves fraud and may include all or any of the following namely a indulging in an act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market;\nINSIDER TRADING REGULATIONS 1992 Regulation 3 Prohibition on dealing communicating or counselling on matters relating to insider trading No insider shall— i either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person deal in securities of a company listed on any stock exchange when in possession of any unpublished price sensitive information;\nAdjudication Order in respect of Urmiladevi J Agarwal in the matter of M s Nova Petrochemicals Ltd June 29 2010 SEBI ACT 1992 Regulation 12 Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control.\nNo person shall directly or indirectly – c engage in any act practice course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with the issue dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made d engage in insider trading e deal in securities while in possession of material or nonpublic information or communicate such material or nonpublic information to any other person in a manner which is in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;\nI have taken into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case the submissions made by the noticee and the material available on the record.\nOn perusal of the documents available on record as well as the submissions made by the Noticee I find that the NPL made major corporate announcements on 6 days during the period January 23 2006 to March 08 2006.\nThese announcements were related to quarterly financial results Bonus issue and expansion plan.\nI note from the SCN that except for announcement on an expansion plan all other announcements were implemented by NPL.\nI note from the SCN that the announcement made by NPL on February 20 2006 regarding expansion plan was No genuine and misleading in nature as the Annual Report of FY 200506 and 200607 did No reflect any information about the expansion plan being undertaken or executed by the company.\nI also note that the price of the scrip after the above announcement went up from Rs 102.50 on February 20 2006 to Rs 146.85 on March 8 2006.\nIt is noted from the SCN that the NPL incurred a loss of Rs 5.23 crore as on 31st March 2006 whereas the sum total of the unaudited figures for the quarter ending June to March 2006 showed a profit of Rs 1.38 crore.\nSince Adjudication Order in respect of Urmiladevi J Agarwal in the matter of M s Nova Petrochemicals Ltd June 29 2010 there was a substantial difference in the unaudited and audited results NPL was asked to clarify the same and the explanation of NPL was No accepted as it failed to substantiate the same.\nThe NPL thus gave misleading results to the public.\nFrom the trade and order log it is observed that the 25 PACs including the Noticee offloaded 1015433 shares which was12.80% of the traded volume on the exchanges NSE and BSE and 7.52% of total capital in the market after the positive announcements related to expansion plan were made by the company.\nThe PACs who sold the shares were the family members and group companies of the Chairman  Mr Vedprakash Chiripal and Managing Director  Mr Shyam Gupta.\nI note from the SCN as well as from the noticee’s submission that she had sold 45700 shares on February 27 2006 against its holding of 45800 shares as on March 31 2005.\nI note that the PACs held 35.31% of the total capital of NPL as on March 31 2005 and the noticee held 0.96% of the PACs’ holding.\nI also note that the noticee’s sale of 45700 shares constitutes 4.5% of the total shares sold by the PACs during the investigation period.\nI note from the material available on record that there is no allegation about the noticee’s involvement in any of these misleading announcements or resultant price rise in the scrip of NPL.\nIn fact I note from the investigation report that the noticee has dealt in the scrip after NPL made misleading announcements which influenced the price and the volume.\nI note that Regulations 3a and 3d of FUTP prohibits a person to deal in securities in a fraudulent manner and engage in any act practice course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person respectively with regard to ‘issue’ ‘purchase’ or ‘sale’ of any security listed or proposed to be listed at a recognized stock exchange.\nFurther Regulation 41 and 42 prohibit persons from indulging in fraudulent or unfair trade practices while dealing in securities.\nWhat is being alleged against the noticee is that she played a fraud and committed an unfair practice within the meaning of the regulations while trading in the scrip of NPL.\nIt is a serious allegation Adjudication Order in respect of Urmiladevi J Agarwal in the matter of M s Nova Petrochemicals Ltd June 29 2010 warranting precise particulars to establish the manner in which the noticee has played a fraud or committed the unfair trade practice.\nTherefore in absence of any corroborative evidence available in the SCN and material available before me I am No inclined to hold the noticee guilty of violating the provisions of Regulation 3a3d 41 and 42a of FUTP Regulations and Regulation 12Ac of the Act.\nBefore dealing with the issue as to whether the noticee violated the provisions of regulation 3i of PIT Regulations I note the definition of insider and price sensitive information under PIT Regulations as follows Regulation 2e “insider” means any person who is or was connected with the company or is deemed to have been connected with the company and is reasonably expected to have access to unpublished price sensitive information in respect of securities of company or has received or has had access to such unpublished price sensitive information.\nRegulation 2c “connected person” means any person who i “is a director as defined in clause 13 of section 2 of the Companies Act 1956 1 of 1956 of a company or is deemed to be a director of that company by virtue of subclause 10 of section 307 of that Act” Regulation 2h “person is deemed to be a connected person” if such person— i is a company under the same management or group or any subsidiary company thereof within the meaning of sub section 1B of section 370 or subsection 11 of section 372 of the Companies Act 1956 1 of 1956 or subclause g of section 2 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1969 54 of 1969 as the case may be; viii relatives of the connected person Regulation 2ha “price sensitive information” means any information which relates directly or in directly to a company and which if published is likely to materially affect the price of securities of company.\nExplanation—The following shall be deemed to be price sensitive information— i periodical financial results of the company; ii intended declaration of dividends both interim and final; iii issue of securities or buyback of securities; iv any major expansion plans or execution of new projects.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Urmiladevi J Agarwal in the matter of M s Nova Petrochemicals Ltd June 29 2010 v amalgamation mergers or takeovers; vi disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking; vii and significant changes in policies plans or operations of the company;\nRegulation 2 k “unpublished” means information which is No published by the company or its agents and is No specific in nature.\nI note from the noticee’s submission that because she is related to  Mr Ved Prakash Chiripal the Chairman of NPL she falls within the ambit of PAC.\nThus there is no dispute about the noticee being an insider as defined under Regulation 2 of PIT Regulations.\nFurther I do No find any merit in the submission of noticee that the announcement of expansion of poly condensation and power plant was No sensitive as the expansion schemes were for captive consumption.\nI note that the information related to financial results and expansion plan falls within the definition of price sensitive information as defined in the Regulation 2 of PIT Regulations.\nThe Hon’ble SAT in the case of Rajiv B Gandhi Sandhya R Gandhi Amis B Gandhi Vs Securities and Exchange Board of India Appeal No 50 of 2007 has also observed that “Unpublished price sensitive information has been defined in the regulations to mean any information which relates to any of the matters referred to in sub clause i to viii of regulation 2k and is No generally known or published by the company for general information but which if published or known is likely to materially affect the price of the securities of the company in the market.\nIn other words any information which is No known but if known could either way affect the price of the scrip of the company would be unpublished price sensitive information.\nThis includes among others financial results of the company intended declaration of dividend – both interim and final amalgamations mergers and takeovers.”\nThe contention of the noticee that simply because she is related to and are known to one of the promoters does No establish that she was aware of the financial results or other price sensitive information of NPL may also No Adjudication Order in respect of Urmiladevi J Agarwal in the matter of M s Nova Petrochemicals Ltd June 29 2010 hold good as being an insider related to Mr Ved Prakash Chiripal the Chairman of NPL she is reasonably expected to have access to unpublished price sensitive information of NPL.\nThis is also evident form the fact that when the price of the scrip after the above misleading announcements went up from Rs 102.50 on February 20 2006 to Rs 146.85 on March 8 2006 the noticee who is related to Mr Ved Prakash Chiripal the Chairman of NPL sold 45700 shares on February 27 2006 and continues to hold only 100 shares.\nThus the bald denial of the noticee that the sale of shares of NPL by her had any correlation with the alleged misleading announcement and nongenuine results made by NPL may No be sufficient to absolve the noticee from charges of violating the provisions of regulation 3i of PIT Regulations read with Section 12 Ad & e of SEBI Act 1992.\nThe aforesaid facts and circumstances clearly establish that the Noticee who is an insider as she falls in the ambit of connected person being related to the Chairman of the Company and reasonably having access to the price sensitive information sold substantial number of shares when in possession of the unpublished price sensitive information of misleading expansion plan and No genuine financial results made by NPL.\nThe standard of proof required in a proceeding of this nature is at variance with the standard of proof required in criminal cases.\nIt is sufficient if the preponderance of probabilities suggests towards the indulgence of the delinquent in the misconduct.\nThe strict rules of Evidence Act and proof beyond reasonable doubt are No applicable to a proceeding of this nature.\nThe Supreme Court’s decision in Gulabchand vs Kudilal AIR 1966 SC 1734 and the decision of the Special Court for trial of offences relating to transactions in securities in the matter of National Housing Bank versus ANZ Grindlays Bank 1998 2  LJ 153 is relied upon in this regard.\nIn view of the foregoing I hold that the allegation of violation of provisions of regulations 3i of PIT Regulations and Section 12 Ad & e of SEBI Act 1992 against the noticee stands established.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Urmiladevi J Agarwal in the matter of M s Nova Petrochemicals Ltd June 29 2010 LEVY OF PENALTY 27.\nThe Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI Vs.\nShri Ram Mutual Fund [2006] 68 SCL 216SC held that “In our considered opinion penalty is attracted as soon as the contravention of the statutory obligation as contemplated by the Act and the Regulations is established and hence the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes wholly irrelevant…”.\nThus the violation of sections 12A d&e of SEBI Act and regulation 3 i of PIT Regulations by the Noticee makes her liable for penalty under section 15G i of the SEBI Act1992.which read as follows 15G.Penalty for insider trading  If any insider who i either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person deals in securities of a body corporate listed on any stock exchange on the basis of any unpublished price sensitive information 29.\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under section 15 G i it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under “15J Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nIn the absence of material available on record the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made as a result of the default and the amount of loss caused to the investors due to the said default cannot be quantified.\nI note that the noticee being an insider traded in the scrip when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information which is prohibited under the SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 and also under SEBI Act 1992.\nThere is no material available on record to suggest that default of the noticee is of repetitive nature.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Urmiladevi J Agarwal in the matter of M s Nova Petrochemicals Ltd June 29 2010 ORDER 31.\nAfter taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case and on a judicious exercise of the powers conferred upon me I hereby impose a monetary penalty of Rs 50000  Rupees Fifty Thousand only on Smt.\nUrmiladevi J Agarwal which will be commensurate with the violation committed by her.\nUrmiladevi J Agarwal shall pay the said amount of penalty by way of demand

Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd a 13.\nMr Ashok Jain was authorised Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd by the Board of RPIL to make investments upto the limits allowed under the Board resolution from time to time.\nOn 25th April 2006  Mr Jain was specifically authorised by a resolution of the board of directors of RPIL to invest up to 30 crores in the equity shares of IPCL.\nThe minutes of this board meeting clearly indicate that RPIL had made a decision to commence creeping acquisition of IPCL shares.\nAnnexed hereto and marked as “Annexure 3” is a copy of the extract of board minutes dated 25th April 2006.\nThereafter on 4th January 2007 the Board of RPIL once again resolved to further acquire IPCL shares up to additional 100 crores.\nAnnexed hereto and marked as “Annexure 4” is a copy of the extract of board minutes dated 4th January 2007.\nIt was after these resolutions in April 2006 and January 2007 that  Mr Ashok Jain started purchasing shares of IPCL from May 2006 and thereafter in February March 2007.\nIt is again reiterated that  Mr Ashok Jain at no time had access to any unpublished price sensitive information and the purchases of IPCL by him for and on behalf of RPIL were for the purpose of creeping acquisitions which acquisition decisions were taken by the board of directors of RPIL in April 2006 and January 2007.\nThereafter the share prices of IPCL started increasing and it touched even 325 per share.\nThereafter the price starting witnessing a downward trend and settled at around 250 to 260 per share.\nBetween July 2006 to February 2007 the price was in the range of 255 to 325.\nIt was only in the third week of February 2007 the price witnessed a fall to around 250 and it was decided to purchase further quantity towards creeping acquisition.\nAs can be seen it was No for the first time that RPIL purchased the shares of IPCL on 27th February 2007.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd iii Accordingly  Mr K Sethuraman Vice President – Corporate Secretarial of RIL informed the stock exchanges about the proposed board meeting on 10th March 2007 for consideration of payment of interim dividend. iv The information regarding proposed declaration of interim dividend by IPCL was known only to  Mr Mukesh Ambani  Mr K Sethuraman and  Mr S.K Anad and Ms.Sasikala Rao and was No known to anyone else prior to the notification to stock exchange by IPCL on 2nd March 2007. v 29.2 IPCL closed its trading window as per its Insider Trading Code only on 2nd March 2007 which closure continued till 24 hours after 10th March 2007 date of Board Meeting of IPCL declaring interim dividend and approving the amalgamation of IPCL and RIL.\nGiven that the trading window had got shut on 2nd March 2007 when the UPSI being the proposal for interim dividend came into existence there was no requirement to shut the trading window again for the second UPSI being the proposed merger.\nThis fact clearly demonstrates that even according to IPCL no unpublished price sensitive information regarding declaration of interim dividends existed prior to the corporate announcement made on 2nd March 2007. w 29.3.\nHowever the SCN sets out that  Mr Mukesh Ambani is the Chairman of both IPCL and RIL.\nTwo bodies corporate are deemed to be under the same management under sub clause ii of Section 370 1B of the Companies Act 1956 if within the six months immediately preceding the directors of one body constitute a majority on the board of the other body.\nDirector

of RIPL did No constitute a majority on the board of IPCL or vice versa as there was no overlap in the directorships of the two companies. gg 39.\nTwo bodies corporate are deemed to be under the same management under sub clause iii of Section 370 1B if No less than onethird of the total voting power relating to each of the two bodies corporate is exercised or controlled by the same individual or body corporate.\nIt is imperative to establish that the same individual or body corporate holds more than a third of the voting rights with the respect to both the companies being examined for the purposes of this clause. hh 40.\nTwo bodies corporate are deemed to be under the same management under sub clause iv of Section 370 1B if the holding company of one body corporate is under the same management as the other within the purview of sub clauses i ii or iii of Section 370 1B.\nWhilst Regulation 3 of the PIT Regulations prohibits “insiders” Regulation 3A of the PIT Regulations prohibits companies in possession of UPSI.\nClauses 1 and 2 of Regulation 3B of the PIT Regulations provide defences to a company referred to under Regulation 3A.\nRPIL thereafter has transferred these shares to another company within Reliance Group.\nThus RPIL purchased 1198457 shares of IPCL during the period of May – June 2006.\nNoticee vide its letter dated 05.11.2012 requested to prepone the date of hearing to 08.11.2012 due to unavailability of its counsel on 16.11.2012.

V Bet\nar  Mr Jyotindra Thacker and  Mr Subramaniam Directors of RPIL and  Mr Ashok C. Jain authorized signatory of RPIL to invest 30 crores by acquiring equity shares of IPCL.\nThe minutes of this board meeting clearly indicate that RPIL had made a decision to commence creeping acquisition of IPCL shares.\nAnnexed hereto and marked as “Annexure 4” is a copy of the extract of board minutes dated April 25 2006.\nThereafter RPIL purchased approximately 12 lakh shares of IPCL at 205 Rs 220 per share between May to June of 2006.\nThe investment limit agreed to in the board meeting on April 25 2006 was almost exhausted in June 2006.\nThereafter the share prices of IPCL started increasing and it even touched 325 per share as a result of which further shares were No purchased.\nFrom July 2006 to February 2007 the price of the shares of IPCL was in the range of 255 to 325.\nMeanwhile the board of directors of RPIL in its meeting on January 4 2007 once again resolved to invest a further sum of 100 Crore to purchase the share of IPCL on a creeping basis.\nIn the third Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd week of February the price of the shares of IPCL fell to approximately 250 thereby bringing the shares into the price range at which RPIL was agreeable to invest.\nAnnexed hereto and marked as “Annexure 5” is a copy of the extract of board minutes dated January 4 2007.\nThe share price movement of IPCL showing the above details is annexed hereto and marked as “Annexure 6”.\nRegulation 2e of the PIT Regulations stipulate that an ‘insider’ is a person who a is or was connected with the company or is deemed to have been connected with the company AND is reasonably expected to have access to unpublished price sensitive information in respect of securities of a company;\n… 18.12 c Section 3701B iii of the companies Act 1956 Two bodies corporate are deemed to be under the same management under subclause iii of section 3701B of the Companies Act 1956 if No less than onethird of the total voting power relating to each of the two bodies corporate is exercised or controlled by the same individual or body corporate.\nTo summarise 1st. for the requirement to be satisfied a triangular corporate structure is contemplated where one entity namely “A” should Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd hold shares in two entities namely “B” and “C” for “B” and “C” to be “companies under the same management”.\nThe composition of the board of directors during 200607 of all the intermediary companies is annexed hereto and marked as “Annexure 10” collectively.\n………………………” 19.\nVide office note hereinafter also referred to as “ON office note” dated 27.01.2016 certain information documentary evidence were sought from the concerned department hereinafter referred to as “OD”.\nOD vide its office note dated 01.02.2016 replied to the aforesaid office note dated 27.01.2016 Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd along with copies of documents in the matter.\nIn response to the same OD vide its office note dated 03.02.2016 provided certain documents in the matter.\nThe documents and comments of OD have been referred in the subsequent part of this order.\nAfter perusal of the material available on record I have the following issues for consideration viz.\nA.

Further the price of the share closed at 237.40 on 05.03.2007. 26.\nI also note from the IR that IPCL made announcement of consideration and recommendation of amalgamation of IPCL with RIL on 07.03.2007 after the close of trading hours.\nThe price of IPCL share on BSE closed at 259.80 on 08.03.2007 from the previous close of 231.65 on 07.03.2007. 27.\nI also note from the IR that “ It is seen from the above that share price of IPCL has more or less moved in sync with the sensex movement as observed in their respective declines on March 5 2007 subsequent to the announcement of the dividend by the company.\nIn fact on March 5 2007 scrip declines by 8.13% on BSE when the SENSEX declined by 3.79%.\nBut in a divergence from the index the scrip witnessed substantial price gain on March 8 2007 and March 9 2007 subsequent to the important announcement of amalgamation of IPCL with RIL.”\nIt is noted from the IR that the price of IPCL shares declined subsequent to the announcement in connection with the interim dividend and that the same has more or less moved in sync with the SENSEX movement.\nHowever the IR has attributed to the rise in the price of IPCL shares on 08.03.2007 and 09.03.2007 to the announcement of amalgamation of IPCL with RIL.\nISSUE B When were the aforesaid two announcements made public by IPCL?\nAccording to the IR and as per the submissions of the Noticee vide its letter dated 08.02.2016 the announcement regarding declaration of interim dividend was made public by IPCL on 02.03.2007 at 1428 hrs.\nWhen OD was Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd asked to provide the supporting documents in connection with this announcement mentioned in the IR it provided a copy of the announcement archives for the period October 12 2006 – March 07 2007 from the BSE website referred by it as Flag A and first 4 pages of analysis report of stock exchanges referred at para 1 of this order along with a copy of an email dated 19.02.2013 from BSE referred by it as Flag B clarifying that the first announcement made by IPCL was received at BSE at 1352 hrs on 02.03.2007 and was disseminated on BSE website at 1401 hrs.\nFurther the announcement time 14.28 hrs stated in analysis report was the dissemination time at NSE as the report was combined by NSE.\nI note from the records that during the hearing before previous AO the Noticee has submitted that the time of announcement at BSE is 1401 hrs.\nFurther as per the copy of announcement dated 02.03.2007 submitted by the Noticee as Annexure I to its reply dated 08.02.2016 the time of this announcement at BSE is 1401 hrs.\nIn view of the above it can be concluded that the 1st PSI w.r.t. declaration of interim dividend was made public by IPCL on 02.03.2007 at 1401 hrs.\nIt is noted from the material made available on record that the 2nd PSI w.r.t. amalgamation of IPCL with RIL was made public on 07.03.2007 at 1715 hrs.\nISSUE C If the aforesaid two announcements were PSI when did they come into existence?\n1st PSI 32.\nThe Noticee’s submissions w.r.t. existence of the 1st PSI vide its replies dated 05.11.2012 08.02.2016 and at the time of hearings before the previous AO and the undersigned have been considered.\nIn short it is Noticee’s submission that the first announcement was made on 02.03.2007 within a couple of hours after the discussion between Shri S K Ananad and Shri Sethuraman on the said date.\nThe material available on record for this purpose have been already provided please refer to para 3 xiii of the ON dated February 01 2016..”\nI No proceed to record my findings on the issue based on material available on record.\nThe Noticee has submitted that since the Union Budget on 28.02.2007 contained a proposal to enhance the dividend distribution tax Shri S.K. Anand Wholetime Director of IPCL on 02.03.2007 advised Ms. Shashikala Rao Company Secretary of IPCL and Shri K Sethuraman Vice President Corporate Secretarial of RIL who also oversaw secretarial activities of the subsidiaries and associate companies of RIL to call a board meeting of IPCL to consider declaration of interim dividend.\nWhile no records of these communications have been submitted by the Noticee it has submitted affidavits of Shri K Sethuraman Shri S.K. Anand and Shri Mukesh Ambani in support of its submissions.\nAs regards Noticee’s contention about “announcement was made on 02.03.2007 within a couple of hours after the discussion between…” I note that at the time of the hearing on 01.02.2016 the representatives had submitted a ‘list of dates and events’ & verbally mentioned the timings of the various events mentioned therein.\nSince the representatives verbally mentioned the timings of various events they were asked to put the timings of various events on record.\nAlthough the representatives undertook to submit the aforesaid information they have No furnished specific time of the discussion.\nWith respect to the Noticee’s submission that it has ascertained that IPCL closed its trading window on 02.03.2007 when the 1st PSI came into existence it is noted that supporting documents have No been submitted by the Noticee to substantiate its claim.\nThis indicates that the decision to appoint the intermediaries was apparently taken before the 5th of March.\nTo a query seeking documentary evidence with regard to the aforesaid assumption OD vide its ON dated 01.02.2016 informed that “The abovementioned statement appears to be a conclusion drawn by the Investigating Officer based on the material on record and EFD has no comments to offer in the matter”.\nThe IR has observed that process of deciding the merger ratio between RIL and IPCL started on 05.03.2007. Further the IR has observed that the decision to appoint the intermediaries was apparently taken before 05.03.2007. IR has No provided any material or a specific date ‘before 05.03.2007’ for this inference.\nOn a perusal of the letter of engagement of various intermediaries involved in the merger process it is noted that all the letters are dated on or after 05.03.2007. IR has observed that based on facts and circumstances and subject to entity’s replies process of data collection must have started before 05.03.2007.\nIn view of the above and in absence of any indication in IR as to when the 2nd PSI came into existence and in absence of any evidence direct or circumstantial by the Investigating Authority to establish the existence of PSI before 05.03.2007 I have no material based on which I can differ from the Noticee’s contention that the 2nd PSI came into existence on 04.03.2007. ISSUE D Whether the Noticee and RIL are ‘insider’ as per Regulation 2e of PIT Regulations?\nThe provision of Regulation 2 e of PIT Regulations is as under e insider” means any person who is or was connected with the company or is deemed to have been connected with the company and who is reasonably expected to have access to unpublished price sensitive information in respect of securities of a company or who has received or has had access to such unpublished price sensitive information.\nThe provision of Regulation 2 h of PIT Regulations is as under “person is deemed to be a connected person” if such person— i is a company under the same management or group or any subsidiary company thereof within the meaning of subsection 1B of section 370 or subsection 11 of section 372 of the Companies Act 1956 1 of 1956 or subclause g of section 2 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1969 54 of 1969 as the case may be; or 47.\nFurther the allegation in the SCN that Noticee was in possession of UPSI has been detailed at para 6g of this order.\nAlso the allegation in the SCN that the Noticee and RIL are considered as ‘insider’ has been detailed at para 6f of this order.\nThe submissions of the Noticee with respect to the same have also been detailed at prepages in this order.\nThe requirement under the applicable provision i.e  Section 370 1B i a of Companies Act 1956 is that the managing agent secretaries and treasurers managing director or manager of the one body corporate should be the same as that of the other body corporate.\nI note from the Annual Report of RIL for the year 20052006 as made available by the OD that Shri Mukesh Ambani was the Chairman of IPCL and was also the Chairman and Managing Director of RIL.\nSection 3701B iii of the Companies Act 1956 reads as under 1B For the purposes of sub sections 1 and 1A] two bodies corporate shall be deemed to be under the same management … iii if No less than one third of the total voting power with respect to any matter relating to each of the two bodies corporate is exercised or controlled by the same individual or body corporate; or 51.\nOn a perusal of the aforesaid section it is noted that the section envisages a triangular structure where one individual or body corporate has to exercise onethird or more total voting power over each of the two body corporates to be considered as companies under same management.\nAs regards to the Noticee’s submission that RPIL and IPCL are No deemed to be under the same management of RIL in terms of Section 370 1B iii of Companies Act 1956 I note from the IR that RIL holds the entire share capital of RPIL through two of its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nAs per the information submitted by RPIL RVL holds 50% of the paidup capital of RPIL RPPL holds 25% of the RPIL and RNPL holds the balance 25% of RPIL.\nRVL is wholly owned subsidiary of RIL.\nRSIL which is also a whollyowned subsidiary of RIL holds 40% of the paidup capital of RPPL and 30% of the paidup capital of RNPL with the balance holding in each of these two companies cross held by them.\nIn effect it is observed that RSIL holds 50% shares of RPIL when shorn 33.33 % or more Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd of the intricacy of cross holdings.\nTherefore RIL holds 100% share capital of RPIL since it is the holding company of both RSIL and RVL.\nIt is noted from material available on record that the Noticee held 46% of share capital in IPCL as on 31.03.2006.\nAs per the disclosures made by IPCL under Regulation 8 3 of SAST Regulations as on 31.03.2006 RPIL is named as a “promoter having control over the company”.\nFurther RIL has been shown as a “persons acting in concert” with RPIL.\nAs stated above RIL holds 100% share capital of RPIL through its various subsidiaries.\nOn a perusal of Section 370 1B iii of Companies Act 1956 it is noted that the provision states that No less than onethird of the total voting power with respect to any matter relating to each of the two bodies corporate has to be exercised or controlled by the same individual or body corporate.\nIn view of the aforesaid findings at paras 5556 I note that RIL excercises more than onethird voting power in both the companies RPIL and IPCL.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd Was the Noticee in possession of the UPSI?\nTherefore it is clear that RIL was having the entire control over RPIL and the employees of RIL were making investment decisions on behalf of RPIL.\nIt is also pertinent to mention that Shri K Sethuraman was the contact person on behalf of RIL for interacting with the legal advisor valuers financial advisors etc. in the matter of merger of RIL with IPCL.\nRVL is a wholly owned subsidiary of RIL.\nCorrespondence between RPIL and SEBI  Flag D and F.” 63.\nIt is noted from disclosures under Regulation 8 3 of SEBI Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations 1997 as on March 31 2006 Noticee is named as a “promoter having control over the company” with the total shareholding of 46% of IPCL.\nThe Noticee on the other hand has given the names of officials who discussed on

performance of his duties in RIL also oversaw the secretarial activities of the subsidiaries and associate companies of RIL which includes the Noticee was involved in the said process.\nIR has further observed that Shri Ashok C Jain who is an employee of RIL was placing the orders to buy shares of IPCL which the Noticee has No disputed.\nI note that Noticee has stated that Shri Ashok Jain was the “Principal Officer” of RPIL under RBI’s NBFC Regulations and enclosed an extract of board minutes of RPIL dated 25.04.2006 in this regard.\nFurther the Noticee has stated that Shri Ashok Jain was

commercial decision.\nTo substantiate its claim the Noticee has submitted documentary evidence in the form of minutes of Board Meeting held on 25.04.2006 and 04.01.2007. 66.\nI note from the minutes of the aforesaid Board meeting held on 04.01.2007 i.e  more than a month earlier to the date when the 1st PSI came into existence that Directors of RPIL and Shri Ashok C Jain were authorized by the Board of RPIL to invest on its behalf in the shares of IPCL upto a limit of 100 crore.\nIR has also observed that the Noticee has No dealt in the shares of IPCL during the period June 09 2006 to

common SCN was also issued to the other Noticee i.e MJVVD Prakash MD of Ranklin for alleged violation of SEBI Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to the Securities Market Regulations 2003 SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 SEBI Substantial Acquisitions of Shares and Takeovers Regulations 1997 Listing Agreement etc.\nIt is observed that the referred common SCN was duly delivered to Prakash.\nFurther vide Notice dated February 23 2018 Noticee was granted an opportunity to appear for personal hearing on March 09 2018 however the same was returned undelivered.\nAlso an attempt made to affix the Notice dated February 23 2018 could No be materialized since the present occupants did No allow to paste the SCN.\nSubsequently the Notice dated

a Hindi daily newspaper Swatantra Vaartha and a newspaper in vernacular language i.e  Telegu in Sakshi newspaper having wide circulation in the state of Telangana informing the Noticees to download

also granted an opportunity of hearing before the Adjudicating Officer on May 09 2018.\nSubsequently the then AO rescheduled the hearing. http www.sebi.gov.in Adjudication Order passed in respect of Ranklin Solutions Ltd in the matter of Ranklin Solutions Ltd 8.\nRanklin vide letter dated March 14 2018 received on May 02 2018 while acknowledging the receipt of referred SCN and Notice dated February 23 2018 has filed reply to the SCN.\nIt is further observed that the letter dated March 14 2018 was issued from the same address to which the SCN and hearing notice were delivered.\nThe relevant extracts of the reply filed by Ranklin are as follows a.\nThe company obtained the consent of the shareholders by way of special resolution passed through postal ballot held on 15 04 2010 for issue offer and allot Equity Shares Warrants and or any instruments convertible into Equity Shares whether optionally or otherwise Global Depository Receipts GDRs American Depository Receipts ADRs or Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds FCCB hereinafter referred to as ‘Securities’ for an aggregate sum of USD 22 million United States Dollars Twenty Two Millions Only. b.\nThe resolution is essentially an enabling one and relates to a proposal to offer issue and allot Equity shares Depository Receipts and or the appropriate securities up to an amount No exceeding USD 22 million United State Dollars Twenty Two Millions only inclusive of premium on Equity shares in the course of domestic international offerings. c.\nIt was also mentioned in the explanatory statement to the notice of the Postal Ballot that the issue will be done after considering the prevailing market conditions and all other relevant factors.\nHowever due to unfavorable market conditions the company could No proceed further with the GDR ADR issue.\nAs said the resolution passed by the shareholders through postal ballot is only enabling resolution and there is no compulsion that the company should come out with GDR issue since the resolution is passed by the shareholders of the company. d.\nWe further submit that the company sincerely tried to raise funds and taken up all the necessary steps including Board meeting and intimating to BSE etc.\nHowever the market condition was very poor and highly discouraging and as a result the Company could No proceed further with GDR.\nHence we submit that corporates announcement was made with any intention to implement GDR and but No with the intention of distorting the market and influencing the decision of investors or to defraud or to deceit anyone. e.\nThe Company had declared a dividend of Re.1 per share and Rs 50 paisa per share in the years 200910 and 201011 respectively.\nHowever the Company had outstanding secured and unsecured loans payable to banks and other creditors to the tune of Rs 9.09 crores as on 31.03.2011. There was tremendous amount of pressure on the Company from the banks and the others for repayment of loans.\nThe financial position of the Company was in doldrums.\nThe Company was struggling to serve its debt and there was no money to pay to the shareholders.\nNonpayment of dividend to the shareholders was purely unintentional as the circumstances were much beyond the control of the Company and were No in favour of the Company as the management was working day in and day out to meet the impending financial obligations of the banks and creditors.\nThe Company also lost its valuable human resources in the process and the business as well. f.\nThe Company was never listed on BSE and did No sign any listing agreement with it.\nHowever its equity shares were traded under permitted category.\nSince the Company was No listed on BSE disclosures pertaining to SEBI SAST and PIT Regulations and other clauses pertaining to Listing Agreement were No given to BSE.\nBSE stopped the trading in the shares of the Company w.e.f 26.10.2015. g.\nThe Company has in place code of Internal Procedure and Conduct and Code of Corporate Disclosure Practice in terms of PIT Regulations 1992.\nIt is submitted that the Coe of Conduct has been made pursuant to Regulations 121 of SEBI PIT Regulations 1992 and in accordance with the Model Code of Conduct as per Schedule 1part A of the SEBI PIT Regulations 1992 and Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement with the stock exchanges.\nA copy of the same is enclosed for the perusal of SEBI. h.\nIt is further submitted that there were debit balances in  Mr MJVVD Prakash’s account with Bonanza Portfolio Limited BPL and India Infoline Limited IIFL.\nIt is also true that in case of BPL he paid partial amount towards outstanding debit balances though he was undergoing extremely bad financial conditions.\nHaving understood that he failed to pay the debit balances he did No pay attention or raised any objection on their sale of shares without his knowledge to recover their dues. i.\nTrading members have stated that the shares were sold with his consent probably it must be to avoid the attraction of wrath of SEBI on unauthorized trades which can be understood and appreciated as the same had taken place as he failed to honor his pay in obligation to the said Trading Members. j.\nWe submit that the alleged selftrades as cited in the SCN as having been carried through  Mr MJVVD Prakash are very small in number i.e  only 0.93% of the total market volume and as can be seen the alleged selftrades were miniscule.\nWe submit that the liquidity in the scrip was quite good and thus Adjudication Order passed in respect of Ranklin Solutions Ltd in the matter of Ranklin Solutions Ltd heavily traded.\nThe alleged trades were little quantum and the said trades could No have affected the prices or otherwise mattered.\nSubsequent to the transfer of the present proceedings vide Notice dated January 11 2019 Noticee was granted an opportunity to appear before the new Adjudicating Officer for the personal hearing dated January 28 2019.\nThe Notice dated January 11 2019 was served to the same address from which the reply dated March 14 2018 was received however the referred Notice was returned undelivered.\nSubsequently the Notice dated January 11 2019 was uploaded in the SEBI website.\nIn view of above and in terms of Rule 7d of Adjudication Rules newspaper publication of the SCN Hearing Notices dated February 23 2018 and January 11 2019 were carried out on March 05 2019 in Times of India Navbharat Times Sakshi Telegana Edition and accordingly informed the Noticee to appear before the Adjudicating Officer on March 18 2019.\nOn the date of hearing the Noticee failed to appear before the Adjudicating Officer.\nWhile it was seen that the initially the company responded to the SCN however later in the proceedings the noticee abstained from responding.\nFrom the above it is clear that the Noticee was served SCN and hearing Notices through affixture and subsequently through publication of the Notices in the nationwide newspaper in English Hindi and Regional language in terms of Rule 7c and 7d of the AO Rules 1995 respectively.\nInspite of providing enough opportunity Noticee have failed to appear before the Adjudicating Officer.\nThus the matter is proceeded based on the facts available on record in terms of Rule 47 of the AO Rules 1995.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 12.\nAfter perusal of the material available in record the following issues are for consideration viz. a.\nWhether Ranklin have failed to comply with Section 11C2 and 11C3 of SEBI Act 1992. b.\nDo the violations if any on the part of the Noticee attract any penalty under SEBI Act?\nAdjudication Order passed in respect of Ranklin Solutions Ltd in the matter of Ranklin Solutions Ltd c.\nIf yes what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act?\nISSUE A Whether Ranklin have failed to comply with Section 11C2 and 11C3 of SEBI Act 1992.\n11C 2 of the SEBI Act enjoins upon every person to whom the summons has been issued to produce the documents as sought by the Investigating Authority.\nIt is pertinent to mention that the provisions under Section 11C3 of the SEBI Act grant powers to Investigation Authority ‘IA’ to seek such information or record evidences statement which are relevant or necessary for the purpose of investigations from any person associated with securities market in any manner.\nSEBI during the investigation have issued summons dated May 08 2013 to Ranklin to furnish certain information in the matter.\nThe information sought vide the Summons and the reply of the Noticee are as follows Query “Reasons for No closure of trading windows as per PIT regulations before making announcements to BSE as the MD had traded in the scrip on April 15 2010 before the announcement of approval of issue of GDR and warrants.”\nReply “As explained earlier the trading that took place in the MD’s account is due to No payment of outstanding amounts to the broking houses on the shares which are under pledge most of these transaction have been done in the form of selling by the broking houses to recover there outstanding amounts who usually do No observe any of the PIT regulations.”\nQuery “Failure to disclose transactions in shares by MD as Per 73 of SAST on several dates like May 20 net 36000 shares purchased Reply “It all happened without the knowledge of MD.\nIt is only brokerage houses started dealing in the name of the MD and henceforth the intimations were No made.”\nTo examine the replies of the Noticee furnished by way of letter dated May 17 2013 SEBI sought clarifications from brokers viz.\nBonanza Portfolio Limited and India Infoline Limited for trading done in the account of Prakash.\nThe replies of the brokers are as follows Bonanza Portfolio Limited hereinafter “BPL” “all trades have been executed under client’s instruction and duly confirmed to the client on regular basis.\nTo date no complaint has been received by the company from the client about any discrepancy in the trade financial statements.”\nAdjudication Order passed in respect of Ranklin Solutions Ltd in the matter of Ranklin Solutions Ltd SEBI also observed from the client ledger statement of  Mr MJVVD Prakash as obtained from BPL that as on date May 03 2010  Mr MJVVD Prakash had a debit balance of close to Rs 31.02 lakh in the account which increased to Rs 56.68 lakh as on December 03 2010.\nFurther during the period there were several late payment interest charges @ 18% p.a levied in the account of  Mr MJVVD Prakash by BPL on the outstanding balance.\nMr MJVVD Prakash had also provided a cheque no. 232330 of Rs 10 lakh to reduce the outstanding balance of Rs 56 lakh but the same was dishonored.\nIt is pertinent to note that  Mr MJVVD Prakash had a total of 81148 shares of RSL in the balance maintained with BPL for the F.Y ending 201011.\nIndia Infoline Limited hereinafter “IIFL” “MJVD opened the trading and DP account with India Infoline Limited on May 19th 2010.\nHe had No pledged any shares with India Infoline Ltd Further India Infoline Ltd is No doing any fund based activities and hence no pledge of shares any amount were lent to the client by IIFL.\nKindly note we have No executed any trades on behalf of the client.\nAs per out Risk management system whenever the client had No squared off the purchases or No made the payin of funds within T+3 days the clients’ positions were compulsorily squared off on T+5 basis.\nWhenever the securities were sold immediately the same were considered for the purpose of exposure through our online risk management system.\nAt no point of time the clients’ total exposure was more than the limits permitted by our RMS.\nWhenever there was margin shortfall the client was advised to make payment immediately or square off the position and the same was totally followed.\nAs per our risk management system the client was advised to make the payment immediately or square off the holdings.\nThe client did No make the payment immediately and advised us to sell the positions towards the balance dues.\nAccordingly the sales were affected in the client account on June 11 2010 and June 21 2010 in the client Account.”\nSEBI also observed from the ledger statement Mr MJVVD Prakash maintained with IIFL that he had a debit balance of Rs 20 lakh as on May 20 2010 which got reduced to Rs 157  by the end of investigation period.\nFor the trading days June 11 2010 and June 21 2010 53573 and 7500 shares respectively were sold off from the account of  Mr MJVVD Prakash by IIFL as he had No made the pay in of funds within T+3 days for his trades on May 20 2010 and June 02 2010 respectively.\nBoth these sell transactions were system initiated by IIFL as part of their Risk Management System.\nIt is observed from the ledger statement Prakash maintained with IIFL that he had a debit balance of Rs 20 lakh as on May 20 2010 which got reduced to Rs 157  by the end of investigation period.\nFor the trading days June 11 2010 and June 21 2010 53573 and 7500 shares respectively were sold off from the account of Prakash by IIFL as he had No made the payin of funds within T+3 days for his trades on May 20 2010 and June 02 2010 respectively.\nBoth these sell transactions were system initiated by IIFL as part of their Risk Management System.\nSEBI also observed from the replies of the BPL that orders were placed by the client i.e  Prakash over phone and trade confirmations were sent to him over his Adjudication Order passed in respect of Ranklin Solutions Ltd in the matter of Ranklin Solutions Ltd mobile number.\nThe broker has provided the details of the sms sent for the trades as well as the delivery details of the contract notes for the subject trades.\nAs regards IIFL the trades were initiated due to make full the debit balance of Prakash with the broker by the risk management system.\nIn the entire process the broker has sent the sms alerts and the contract note.\nThe delivery details of the same are part of records.\nFurther copies of contract notes were also delivered to his address and email address.\nFurthermore records show that Prakash had made payment in the ledger account maintained with BPL to lower the outstanding balance which further proves that Prakash was aware of these transactions.\nAll of the above goes to conclude that the Noticee had knowingly provided false information under the summons issued regarding Prakash being unaware of the aforesaid transactions executed in his name which is in violation of Section 11C2 and 11C3 of the SEBI Act where records establish that Prakash was indeed aware of all the trades with both the brokers.\nIt is No in dispute that Ranklin was issued summons under Section 11C2 and 11C3 of the SEBI Act to furnish certain information documents.\nRecords show that the summonses were duly received by the noticee.\nThe information sought by IA was relevant to the investigations and was available only with the noticee.\nFurther the Noticee had also replied to the Summons however made false submissions.\nOn a bare perusal of the information sought from the noticee by the IA it can be concluded that the information sought was in the knowledge of Ranklin as it chose to respond to the summons issued and provided information.\nThe same could No be gathered from any other source without hampering timelines for investigations.\nIt is critical to the investigation process that the information flow is unhampered as a fact finding mission can easily be derailed by entities by No submitting the Adjudication Order passed in respect of Ranklin Solutions Ltd in the matter of Ranklin Solutions Ltd relevant information.\nFurther it is assessed from the requisition of the information that the information was indeed specific to Ranklin.\nAlso during these proceedings Ranklin was granted an opportunity to appear before the Adjudication Officer however the Noticee failed to avail the hearing opportunity.\nThus it is an admitted fact that Ranklin have submitted false information for the Summons issued by IA and accordingly violated Section 11C2 and 11C3 of SEBI Act.\nISSUE B Do the violations if any on the part of the Noticees attract any penalty under SEBI Act?\nIt is clear that if a person fails to comply with the summons of IA he is liable for penalty under Section 15HB of SEBI Act.\nAs the violation of provisions of section 11C2 and 11C3 of SEBI Act 1992 by the noticee i.e  Ranklin Solutions Ltd has been established and it is held that Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under section 15HB of SEBI Act.\nThe noncompliance of Summonses makes Ranklin Solutions Ltd liable for penalty under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act.\nThe provisions of Section 15HB are as follows Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided.\nWhoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act the rules or the regulations made or directions issued by the Board thereunder for which no separate penalty has been provided shall be 2[liable to a penalty which shall No be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees].\nIn this context reliance is placed upon the order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of Chairman SEBI v.\nShriram Mutual Fund {[2006] 5 SCC 361} wherein it was held that In our view the penalty is attracted as soon as contravention of the statutory obligations as contemplated by the Act is established and therefore the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes immaterial.\n………. Hence we are of the view that once the contravention is established then the penalty has to follow and only the quantum of penalty is discretionary.\nAdjudication Order passed in respect of Ranklin Solutions Ltd in the matter of Ranklin Solutions Ltd 30.\nBased on the above it is determined that it is a fit case for imposition of monetary penalty on Ranklin Solutions Ltd ISSUE C If yes what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act?\nWhile determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15HB it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act which is as follows “Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer 15J.\nWhile adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.”\n1[Explanation.—For the removal of doubts it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E clauses b and c of section 15F 15G 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.\nThe available records neither reveals any disproportionate gains unfair advantage made by Ranklin the specific loss suffered by the investors due to such violations and No has such allegations been made against Ranklin.\nHowever it is pertinent to take into account that submitting false information with respect to the summonses has the potential to hamper and waylay the investigations and thus compromises the regulatory framework.\nTherefore taking into consideration the facts circumstances of the case and all of the above factors it is determined that a justifiable penalty needs to be imposed upon Ranklin.\nIn view of above and after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and the factors mentioned in the provisions of Section 15J of the SEBI Act in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the SEBI Adjudication Rules it is concluded that the proceedings against 1 Inserted by Part VIII of Chapter VI of the Finance Act 2017 vide Gazette Notification No 7 Extraordinary Part II Section 1 dated March 31 2017.\nThis shall come into force from April 26 2017.\n2Substituted for the words ―liable to a penalty which may extend to one crore rupees” by the Securities Laws Amendment Act 2014 w.e.f 08092014.\nAdjudication Order passed in respect of Ranklin Solutions Ltd in the matter of Ranklin Solutions Ltd Ranklin stands established in terms of the provisions of the SEBI Act.\nAccordingly a monetary penalty against Ranklin is imposed which is as follows Noticee Name Violated Penal Provisions Amount of Penalty in Rs  Ranklin Solutions Ltd Section 11C2 and 11C3 of SEBI Act 1992 Section 15HB of SEBI Act 1992 2000000  36.\nRanklin shall remit pay the said amount of penalty within 45 forty five days of receipt of this order either by way of Demand Draft DD in favour of “SEBI  Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai or through e payment facility into Bank Account the details whereof are as follows Account No for remittance of penalties levied by Adjudication Officer Bank Name State Bank of India Branch Bandra Kurla Complex RTGS Code SBIN0004380 Beneficiary Name SEBI – Penalties Remittable To Government of India Beneficiary A c No 31465271959 37.\nRanklin shall forward said Demand Draft or the details confirmation of penalty so paid through epayment to the Division Chief Enforcement Department 1 Division of Regulatory Action  II [ EFD1DRAII ] SEBI Bhavan Plot No.C4A‘ G’ Block Bandra Kurla Complex Bandra East Mumbai – 400 051.\nThe Format for forwarding details confirmations of epayments made to SEBI shall be in the form as provided at Annexure A of Press Release No 131 2016 dated August 09 2016 shown at the SEBI Website which is produced as under;\nI.

shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of Naisargik Agritech India Limited 5 The disclosure mentioned in subregulations 3 4 and 4A shall be made within two working days of a the receipts of intimation of allotment of shares or b the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights as the case may be.”\nIt was stated in the SCN that the aforesaid alleged violations if established would make the Noticee liable for monetary penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act which reads as under 15A.\nPenalty for failure to furnish information return etc If any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.”\nThe SCN was served upon by way of Speed Post with Acknowledgment Due SPAD at two addresses of the Noticee as available in the records one of which could No be delivered.\nThe Noticee was advised to furnish his reply towards the SCN within 14 days of its receipt failing which it shall be presumed that the Noticee had no reply to submit and the matter will be proceeded with on the basis of evidence available on record.\nHowever no reply in response to the SCN was submitted by the Noticee.\nOn nonreceipt of any reply towards the SCN an opportunity of personal hearing in the interests of natural justice was provided to the Noticee on January 05 2018 vide hearing notice dated December 13 2017.\nThe Noticee was also advised to submit his reply towards the SCN by December 29 2017.\nThe Hearing Notice was also served upon the Noticee by way of SPAD and acknowledgment of the same is available on records.\nHowever the Noticee did No avail the opportunity of hearing on January 05 2018.\nThereafter a final opportunity of hearing was provided to the Noticee on February 15 2018 vide hearing notice dated January 31 2018.\nThe Noticee was also advised to submit his reply towards the SCN if any by February 14 2018.\nHowever the Noticee Adjudication Order in the matter of Naisargik Agritech India Limited did No submit any reply towards the SCN No did he avail the opportunity of hearing on February 15 2018.\nThe consequences of failure to reply and or nonappearance had been mentioned in the hearing notice dated January 31 2018 wherein the Notice was informed that if no appearance is made by the Noticee then the matter would be decided further on the basis of evidence available on record in terms of Rule 47 of the Adjudication Rules.\nI note that sufficient opportunities to submit reply and to appear for personal hearing have been given to the Noticee none of which were availed by it.\nHence I find it relevant to refer to the order dated December 08 2006 of the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the matter of Classic Credit Ltd v.\nSEBI Appeal No 68 of 2003 wherein it observed “…the appellants did No file any reply to the second showcause.\nThis being so it has to be presumed that the charges alleged against them in the show cause notice were admitted by them”.\nI also find it pertinent to refer to order of the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the matter of Sanjay Kumar Tayal & Ors. v SEBI Appeal 68 of 2013 dated February 11 2014 wherein the Hon’ble SAT had inter alia observed that “..\nAs rightly contended by  Mr Rustomjee learned senior counsel for respondents appellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them No availed opportunity of personal hearing offered to them in the adjudication proceedings and therefore appellants are presumed to have admitted charges leveled against them in the show cause notices..”Thus I am of the view that the allegations levelled in the SCN and the evidences enclosed therewith are No in dispute in absence of any reply from the Noticee.\nKeeping the aforesaid in mind I am of the opinion that the SCN and the Hearing Notice have been duly served upon the Noticee but he has deliberately failed to reply towards the SCN and also failed in availing the opportunity of hearing in this matter.\nI am also of the view that principles of natural justice have been duly followed in the instant matter.\nTherefore the adjudication proceedings against the Noticee are undertaken exparte on the basis of material available on records.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 11.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the instant matter are 11.1 Whether the Noticee had failed to make required disclosure under Regulation 134 read with 135 of the PIT Regulations as alleged in the SCN?\nAdjudication Order in the matter of Naisargik Agritech India Limited 11.2 If yes whether the failure on the part of the Noticee would attract monetary penalty under Section 15A b of the SEBI Act?\n3 If yes what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed upon the Noticee taking into consideration the factors stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 2 of the Adjudication Rules?\nIssue 11.1 Whether the Noticee had failed to make mandated disclosure under Regulation 134 read with 135 of the PIT Regulations as alleged in the SCN?\nRegulation 134 of the PIT Regulations requires any person who is a director or officer of a listed company to disclose to the company and stock exchange where the securities are listed the total number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights within two working days of acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights as the case may be if there has been a change in such holdings of such person from the last disclosure made under Regulation 132 of the PIT Regulations or under Regulation 134 of the PIT Regulations and the change exceeds Rs 5 lakhs in value or 25000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower.\nI have independently perused the Company LLP Master Data with respect to the Company as available on the website of Ministry of Corporate Affairs.\nOn perusal of the same I note that the Noticee Director Identification Number  03611510 has been a director of the Company since July 07 2014.\nThus I note from the aforesaid that the Noticee was a director of the Company during the Examination Period.\nI also note that the BSE vide letter dated January 12 2015 had provided following details of trades carried out by the Noticee in the scrip of Company Sr .

b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nExplanation.\nFor the removal of doubts it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E clauses b and c of section 15F 15G 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.”\nInvestigation did No reveal any specific disproportionate gains or unfair advantage made by the Noticee or specific loss suffered by the investors.\nNo past default against the Noticee was revealed in the investigation report.\nHowever I note that the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the matter of Komal Nahata v.\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India Appeal No 5 of 2014 dated January 27 2014 has held “Argument that no investor has suffered on account of No disclosure and that the AO has No considered the mitigating factors set out under Section 15J of SEBI Act 1992 is without any merit because firstly penalty for No compliance of SAST Regulations 1997 and PIT Regulations 1992 is No dependent upon the investors actually suffering on account of such No disclosure.”\nCorrect and timely disclosures therefore are an essential part of the proper functioning of the securities market and failure to do so results in preventing investors from taking wellinformed decision.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of Naisargik Agritech India Limited 22.\nTaking into account aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case mitigating factors judgments relied on and the purpose of the PIT Regulations I am of the view that a justifiable penalty needs to be imposed upon the Noticee to meet the ends of justice.\nAfter taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case in exercise of powers conferred upon me under Section 15I 2 of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules I hereby impose a penalty of Rs 450000  Rupees Four Lakh Fifty Thousand only upon the Noticee i.e   Mr Amitkumar Rameshchandra Rana under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act for violation of Regulation 134 read with 135 of the PIT Regulations.\nI am of the view that the said penalty would commensurate with the violation committed by the Noticee.\nThe Noticee shall remit pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order either by way of Demand Draft in favour of “SEBI  Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai OR through epayment facility into Bank Account the details of which are given below;\nAccount No for remittance of penalties levied by Adjudication Officer Bank Name State Bank of India Branch BandraKurla Complex RTGS Code SBIN0004380 Beneficiary Name SEBI – Penalties Remittable To Government of India Beneficiary A c No 31465271959 25.\nThe Noticee shall forward said Demand Draft or the details confirmation of penalty so paid to the Enforcement Department – Division of Regulatory Action – I of the SEBI.\nThe format for forwarding details of epayments shall be made in the following tabulated form as provided in the SEBI Circular No SEBI HO GSD T&A CIR P 2017 42 dated May 16 2017 and details of such payment shall be intimated at email ID – tad@sebi.gov.in.

sought for in the communications dated April 18 2015 and May 4 2015 and requested that copies of the other documents be provided at the earliest.\nThe AR further stated that he had become aware of the hearing scheduled on September 8 2015 only on September 1 2015 and that this was a very short notice since he was travelling for work during the said week.\nHence the AR requested that any other date in the third or fourth week of September except 22 9 2015 be fixed for filing of reply and personal hearing without prejudice to his clients’ right to inspection as sought in communications dated April 18 2015 and May 4 2015 and cross examination of witness whose statements are taken during the course of investigation.\nIn view of the same and the request of the AR to reschedule the personal hearing vide common Hearing Notice dated September 16 2015 the Noticees were granted a final opportunity for personal hearing on October 6 2015.\nThe Noticees were advised to note that their AR had acknowledged receipt of item no vii on their list of documents i.e  the reply of  Mr Ankit Mathur dated May 17 2011.\nFurther with respect to documents No i to vi in the said list a reply was sent vide email dated February 26 2014 inadvertently mentioned as February 26 2015 by the Investigation Department of SEBI to  Mr Shyam Shelat.\nSince the AR had stated that no alleged email dated February 26 2014 was ever received by him on behalf of the Noticees from SEBI the said email dated February 26 2014 was once again Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited attached for their reference.\nIn view of the same Noticees were once again advised to file their submissions reply latest by September 28 2015.\nSoft copies of the said letters and Hearing Notices both dated September 16 2015 were also sent by email to the AR on September 22 2015.\nIt is worthwhile to note that this was the fourth time that the email dated February 26 2014 was sent provided to the Noticees their AR.\nDespite the same vide letters dated September 26 2015 the AR  Mr Shyam Shelat inter alia once again stated that he had neither received any email dated February 26 2014 No dated February 26 2015.\nThe AR further stated that without prejudice to his clients’ right to inspection a reply would be submitted by the end of the week.\nSubsequently on October 6 2015 the AR appeared on behalf of the Noticees for the personal hearing.\nIt was clarified to the AR that in the letter dated September 16 2015 email dated February 26 2014 was inadvertently referred to as the email dated February 26 2015 due to a typographical error and that the same may be read as email dated February 26 2014.\nThe AR confirmed that he had received SEBI’s email dated February 26 2014 which was annexed with the letter dated September 16 2015.\nAccordingly all the documents requested as per letters dated April 18 2015 May 4 2015 and May 7 2015 were accepted to have been provided to the satisfaction of the AR of theNoticeesHowever the AR further requested that the documents stated to be available in public domain with the Noticees as per the email dated February 26 2014 may also be provided for ready reference.\nThe AR requested that the Noticees be granted 15 days’ time to file additional submissions on receipt of the documents as stated above.\nSince due to paucity of time the oral submissions for the Noticees could No be completed the AR requested that another opportunity for personal hearing may be granted subsequent to filing of the additional submissions on receipt of the documents referred to above.\nAdjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited 25.\nThe Noticees vide reply dated September 28 2015 submitted that Paksh had informed the company SGWL as per Regulations 134 and 136 of the PIT Regulations 1992.\nA copy of the said disclosures in the prescribed Form D was stated to be attached.\nIt was also stated that the contents averments of the interim replies of Anurag Agarwal and Paksh be read as part of the present reply for the sake of brevity.\nSubsequently after protracted correspondences the hearing for the Noticees were scheduled on May 13 2016.\nHowever the AR vide letter dated May 11 2016 on behalf of  Mr Anurag Agarwal and M s.\nPaksh Developers Pvt Ltd. stated that  Mr Anurag Agarwal was suffering from a debilitating disease affecting the nervous system and was unable to give necessary documents instructions authority to the AR for the hearing and sought a date in the first week of June 2016.\nAnother hearing was scheduled for  Mr Anurag Agarwal and M s Paksh Developers Pvt Ltd on June 8 2016 and the same was communicated to them and the AR vide Hearing Notice dated May 16 2016.\nThe AR vide letter dated June 7 2016 stated that he had just returned from abroad and couldnot attend the hearing as he was suffering from viral throat infection with tonsillitis and requested for it to be rescheduled.\nThe AR proposed three new dates viz.\nJune 24 2016 July 1 2016 or July 8 2016 convenient to him for appearing for the personal hearing.\nHowever due to preoccupation of the AO one of the three said dates could No be granted.\nVide Hearing Notice dated July 7 2016 addressed to the said Noticees with a copy to the AR the Noticees were advised to appear for personal hearing on either August 5 2016 August 12 2016 or August 26 2016 with prior intimation.\nThe above Hearing Notice was also sent to the AR vide email dated July 13 2016.\nOn the scheduled date i.e  August 26 2016 the AR appeared for the personal hearing on behalf of his clients  Mr Anurag Agarwal and Paksh Developers Pvt Ltd and reiterated the submissions made in the replies dated September 28 2015 and Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited February 8 2016.\nThe AR sought time up to September 30 2016 to make additional submissions on behalf of the aforenamed Noticees inter alia in respect of alleged violations of SAST Regulations and disclosure requirement under PIT Regulations as stated in the Show Cause Notice issued to the Noticees since his client  Mr Anurag Agarwal was indisposed.\nAs no additional submissions were received from  Mr Anurag Agarwal and Paksh Developers Pvt Ltd. letter dated February 15 2017 was sent to the said Noticees along with a copy to the AR advising them to submit the relevant details latest by March 3 2017.\nThe AR also submitted that  Mr Anurag Agarwal is indisposed due to a debilitating nervous system ailment and sought additional one month’s time to submit the information.\nSince no submissions reply were received even after lapse of considerable time letters dated August 9 2017 were again sent to  Mr Anurag Agarwal and Paksh Developers Pvt Ltd with a copy to the AR advising them to make additional submissions if any latest by August 31 2017.\nThereafter the AR vide letters dated August 28 2017 submitted that the Noticee  Mr Anurag Agarwal is on the verge of completion of compliance of Order of WTM SEBI pertaining to SAST Regulations.\nFurther Disclosure requirements under PIT regulations have been made at relevant points of time as can be seen from the Noticee’s Affidavit of February 9 2016.\nThereafter hearing was scheduled on December 15 2017 when the AR appeared and reiterated the earlier replies of theNoticees30.\nIt can be therefore seen that that sufficient opportunities of hearing have already been given to all the Noticees by the erstwhile AO.\nHowever despite the same I note that the AR Noticees have No cooperated with the Adjudication proceedings and have deliberately delayed the proceedings by seeking repetitive extensions.\nThereafter pursuant to the transfer of this case to the undersigned vide a hearing Notice dated March 16 2020 the Noticees were asked to attend personal hearing on March 24 2020.\nThe same could No be held due to the lockdown effected due to Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited COVID19 pandemic.\nThereafter on August 28 2020 all the Noticees were provided another opportunity of hearing on September 4 2020.\nThe same was delivered by an email of even date upon the Noticees as well as through speed post.\nNo response was however received from theNoticeesSubsequently vide email dated September 9 2020 the Noticees were provided another opportunity of personal hearing on September 22 2020.\nIt was inter alia stated in the Notice that this shall be the last and final opportunity of hearing being provided to them.\nI am of the opinion that sufficient opportunities of hearing have already been given to all the Noticees as already noted in details and Tabulated in the preceding paragraphs.\nI am therefore of the view that no further opportunities of hearing need to be provided to the Noticees and the matter can be proceeded with on the basis of the submissions made by theNoticeesConsideration of Issues Evidence and Findings 31.\nI have carefully perused the charges against the Noticees mentioned in the SCN the written & oral submissions made by them and the documents as available on record.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the present case are a Whether the Noticees have violated Regulation 71 and Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations 1997? b Whether the Noticee No 3 has violated Regulations 131 and 4 of the PIT Regulations 1992? c Do the violations if any on the part of the Noticees attract any penalty under Sections 15Ab and 15 H of the SEBI Act 1992 respectively? d If yes what should be the quantum of penalty?\nBefore moving forward it will be appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions which read as under  Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited Relevant provisions of SAST Regulations  Acquisition of 5 per cent and more shares or voting rights of a company.\n71 Any acquirer who acquires shares or voting rights which taken together with shares or voting rights if any held by him would entitle him to more than

investigation conducted by SEBI in the scrip of SGWL.\nOn analysis of the shareholding pattern of the company for the quarter ended March 31 2009 it was observed that the share capital of the company was 4239688 shares out of which 2593307 shares 61.17% of the share capital were held by promoters and balance 1646381 shares 38.83% of the share capital were held with non promoters.\nThe same is

ending on 3092009 d.\nThen Anurag Sold 500000 share in the quarter ending on 31122009.\nFurther it was observed that  Mr Hemang S Shah who was No in the list of persons holding more than 1% of the shares of the company for the quarter ended on March 31 2009 was holding 63558 shares 1.50% of the share capital in the subsequent quarter ended on June 30 2009.\nHis name did No appear in the list in the subsequent quarter ended on September 30 2009.\nViolation of SEBI SAST Regulations and disclosure requirements under SEBI Insider Trading Regulations 37.\nWhile investigating the contraventions of the SEBI Act and relevant Regulations it was observed that as per the shareholding of persons belonging to the “Public” category and holding more than 1% of the total number of shares of the Company as per the BSE Website for the quarter ended on June 2007  Mr Anurag Agarwal who was the then MD of the company was holding 11.79% shares of the company.\nFor the quarter ended on September 2007 however it was observed that  Mr Anurag Agarwal was holding 11.79% of the share capital and Paksh in which Anurag Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited Agarwal was the Managing Director was holding 4.72% share capital of the company.\nNo open offer or disclosure was filed by the said entities.\nI note that  Mr Anurag Agarwal and Paksh are connected to each other.\nThe details of the same are as under a.\nMr Anurag Agarwal is the Managing Director of Paksh.\nAs per annual return for year ending on 3132008 filed by Paksh with ROC  Mr Anurag Agarwal was holding 829000 shares of Paksh out of total capital of Paksh i.e  830000 shares.\nThus Anurag Agarwal was holding 99.88% share capital of Paksh. b.\nAnurag Agarwal also admitted in his statement recorded on July 12 2011 that he had placed order on behalf of Paksh for transactions in the scrip of the company. c.\nThus both  Mr Anurag Agarwal and Paksh acquired shares of SGWL for a common objective since the buy sell orders for shares of SGWL by Paksh were also placed by  Mr Anurag Agarwal.\nFurthermore in his statement  Mr Anurag Agarwal has clearly stated that he had bought more than 15% of the shareholding in SGWL along with Paksh since he had the impression that in the future the promoters would invite him to join the promoter group.\nThus it is abundantly clear that  Mr Anurag Agarwal and Paksh were “Persons Acting in Concert” PACs as per Regulation 21e of the SAST Regulations.\nMr Anurag Agarwal and Paksh had acquired shares of the company from quarter June 2005 onwards the details of which are as under Table 2 Date Name of Entity Buy Qty.\nNo of shares Sell Qty.\nCombined holding of Anurag and Paksh at the end of day No of shares % of their holding to Total

2007 in physical form through offmarket transactions at Rs 2.50 and Rs 8 per share respectively.\nDuring the relevant period of purchase the scrip was No having much transaction in the stock exchange.\nNo disclosures were made by Paksh and  Mr Anurag Agarwal for above acquisition of shares of the company as required under the PIT Regulations 1992 and the SAST Regulations 1997.\nMr Anurag Agarwal had also admitted in his statement dated July 12 2011 that no disclosure had been made for above transactions under SAST Regulations 1997 and or the PIT Regulations by  Mr Anurag Agarwal or Paksh.\nI note that  Mr Anurag Agarwal and his PAC Paksh are alleged to have violated a.\nRegulation 71 of the SAST Regulations 1997 by  Mr Anurag Agarwal on two different occasions as under i. acquisition of 5% shares capital on August 18 2005 ii. acquisition of 10% shares capital on July 1 2006 b.\nViolation of Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations 1997 by  Mr Anurag Agarwal and his PAC Paksh jointly on one occasion as under i. acquisition of 14% shares capital on September 20 2007 Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited 42.\nI note that Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations 1997 requires that any acquirer who acquires shares or voting rights which taken together with shares or voting rights if any held by him would entitle him to more than five per cent or ten per cent or fourteen percent or fifty four per cent shares or voting rights in a company in any manner whatsoever shall disclose at every stage the aggregate of his shareholding or voting rights in that company to the company and to the stock exchanges where shares of the target company are listed.\nFrom Table 2 above I note that on May 24 2005  Mr Anurag Agarwal bought 196800 shares amounting to 4.56% of the total paid up share capital of the Company.\nThereafter on August 18 2005  Mr Anurag Agarwal purchased a further 200000 shares of SGWL which took his total shareholding in the company to 396800 shares amounting to 9.20%.\nThus this purchase crossed the 5% threshold prescribed by Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations and hence it was required that a disclosure be made to that effect.\nHowever admittedly  Mr Anurag Agarwal has No made any disclosure in respect of the said purchase.\nThereafter on July 1 2006  Mr Anurag Agarwal again acquired shares of SGWL on this occasion the purchase being 103200 shares.\nThe said purchase combined with his previous holding meant that his holding in the company No stood at 11.79% of the total paid up capital or 500000 shares.\nSince  Mr Anurag Agarwal’s holding had crossed the prescribed threshold of 10% he was once again required to make a disclosure under Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations.\nHowever no such disclosure was made and the same was admitted by  Mr Anurag Agarwal in his statement dated July 12 2011.\nLastly on September 20 2007 Paksh acquired a further 200000 shares of SGWL.\nSince in this specific instance the shares were purchased by Paksh therefore Paksh was the acquirer and  Mr Anurag Agarwal was its PAC.\nThus subsequent to this acquisition the holding of Paksh and its PAC  Mr Anurag Agarwal rose to 700000 shares or 16.41% of the paid up capital of SGWL.\nHowever despite breaching the Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited threshold of 14% sharehoding with this acquisition the two Noticees namely Paksh and its PAC  Mr Anurag Agarwal did No make any disclosure under Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations.\nThe same has been admitted by  Mr Anurag Agarwal in his statement dated July 12 2011.\nHowever during the course of the Adjudication Proceedings Anurag Agarwal and Paksh stated that they had filed the requisite disclosures to the Company in August 2005 July 2006 and September 2007 after crossing the 5% 10% and 14% of the shareholding of SGWL.\nHowever they have submitted that they were No being provided documentary proof of the same by the Company.\nThey stated that they would be relying on the same as and when the documents were available.\nAnurag Agarwal Paksh and their AR were given innumerable opportunities to file their submissions in respect of the same however no documentary evidence has been submitted till date in support of the claim that they had filed the necessary disclosures under Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations.\nI note that the assertion of the noticees during the current proceedings is No only in contradiction to their statement made during the investigation carried out by SEBI it is also No consistent with the documents available on record.\nIt is a matter of record that no disclosures were made to the Exchange in respect of these acquisitions.\nThe AR on behalf of the Anurag Agarwal and Paksh have sought to shift the onus of the same to the Company stating that they reserve the right to shift all effect of the errors and omissions on the part of the company SGWL.\nHowever this argument is No tenable in law as Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations inter alia requires that on breach of the said thresholds of 5% 10% and 14% the acquirer disclose the same to the Company itself and also to the Stock Exchanges where the shares of the company are listed.\nAnurag Agarwal and Paksh have No been able to produce any evidence to show that the requisite disclosures were filed by them to the Company and to the Stock Exchange.\nAdjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited 46.\nIn view of the above I am of the opinion that  Mr Anurag Agarwal violated Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations 1997 on two different occasions by himself and on further one occasion along with Paksh.\nThus I find that  Mr Anurag Agarwal violated Regulation 71 on 3 occasions and Paksh violated Regulation 71 on one occasion.\nFurther it is alleged that  Mr Anurag Agarwal and his PAC Paksh violated Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations by collectively acquiring more than 15% share capital of the company on September 20 2007 without making an open offer.\nPaksh and  Mr Anurag Agarwal vide letter dated July 11 2011 confirmed the above mentioned transactions at Table 2 above.\nThe said transactions were also appearing in the shareholding pattern of the company available on BSE website.\nI note that Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations 1997 states that no acquirer shall acquire shares or voting rights which taken together with shares or voting rights if any held by him or by persons acting in concert with him entitle such acquirer to exercise fifteen percent or more of the voting rights in a company unless such acquirer makes a public announcement to acquire shares of such company n accordance with the Regulations.\nAs noted above  Mr Anurag Agarwal was holding 500000 shares or 11.79% of the shares of SGWL when on September 20 2007 Paksh acquired a further 200000 shares of SGWL.\nAs noted above in this specific instance the shares were purchased by Paksh therefore Paksh was the acquirer and  Mr Anurag Agarwal was its PAC.\nThus subsequent to this acquisition the holding of Paksh and its PAC  Mr Anurag Agarwal rose to 700000 shares or 16.41% of the paid up capital of SGWL.\nAnurag Agarwal has himself admitted that that the purchase and sell Orders were placed by him on behalf of Paksh.\nHence upon crossing the 15% barrier it was imperative that Paksh and its PAC  Mr Anurag Agarwal make an open offer in line with Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations which was No done.\nThus I am of the opinion that  Mr Anurag Agarwal and Paksh have violated the provisions of Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations.\nAdjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited 49.\nI note that in the matter at hand the noticees Anurag Agarwal and Paksh have failed to make any specific submissions with respect to the charge of violation of Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations.\nHowever I note that for the same allegation Section 11B Proceedings were also initiated by SEBI and the Learned Whole Time Member SEBI has passed an Order dated July 5 2016 in the matter.\nWhile in the current proceedings the AR has failed to make submissions despite several opportunities I note from SEBI’s Order dated July 5 2016 that the AR had made submissions in respect of the charge of violation of Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations therein.\nIn respect of the same relevant extract the said Order dated July 5 2016 is produced below “33.\nIn this regard  Mr Anurag Agarwal has submitted that the public offer was given in leading newspaper and submitted a copy of Public Notice published in Western Times newspaper circulated in Ahmedabad.\nIt is relevant to mention that the mandatory Public Announcement under regulation 10 read with regulation 14 of the Takeover Regulations must be made within prescribed time and in accordance with the Takeover Regulations.\nThe scheme of the Takeover Regulations as enshrined in regulation 14 clearly shows that the time limit provided for public announcement is related to the finalization of the agreement or entering into agreement to acquire shares or decision to acquire shares.\nThus for the purpose of this case the date i.e  September 20 2007 when the combined shareholding of the noticees increased beyond the threshold of 15% was the starting point for the purpose of discharge of obligation of the noticees to make public announcement so as to give exit opportunity to the shareholders of SGWL at the best offer price.\nRegulation 15 provides for the requirements of public announcement of offer.\nSuch public announcement is required to be made in all editions of one English Daily with wide circulation one Hindi Daily with wide circulation and one Regional Daily with wide circulation at the place where the registered office of the target company is situated and the place of the stock exchange where the shares of the target company are most frequently traded.\nSimultaneously with such publication a copy of the public announcement should be submitted to SEBI through a registered merchant banker and should be sent to all stock exchanges and the target company for placing the same before the Board of Directors of the target company.\nRegulation 16 Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited lists the contents of the public announcement of offer.\nIn terms of regulation 181 and 182 within 14 days from the date of the public announcement the acquirer is required to file through its merchant banker with SEBI a copy of the draft letter of offer containing disclosures as specified by SEBI.\nThe letter of offer is required to be dispatched to the shareholders No earlier than 21 days from its submissions to SEBI provided that if SEBI specifies any change in the draft letter of offer the merchant banker and the acquirer have to carry out such changes before the letter of offer is dispatched to the shareholders.\nRegulation 20 deals with offer price and regulation 21 deals with minimum number of shares to be acquired in the public offer.\nRegulations 22 23 24 deals with the general obligations of the acquirer board of directors of the target company and the merchant banker respectively.\nThe public offer has to complete on acquisition of shares tendered by the shareholders in the public offer and payment of consideration to the shareholders by the acquirer within the time scheduled stipulated in the Takeover Regulations.\nIn this case the noticees had issued only a public notice which did No satisfy the requirements of the requisite public announcement with regard to its contents and other procedures.\nMere publication of the notice in any newspaper as sought to be contended by the noticees is No a compliance of the Takeover Regulations.\nAdmittedly the shares have No been acquired by the noticees from the shareholders pursuant to any public offer so as to give exit opportunity to the shareholders in accordance with the Takeover Regulations.\nIn fact none of the requirements of the Takeover Regulations have been complied with by the noticees in respect of their acquisition dated September 20 2007.I therefore find that the noticees have failed to make the mandatory public announcement within 4 days from September 20 2007 in accordance with the provisions of the Takeover Regulations.\nThus the notices have contravened the provisions of regulation 10 read with regulation 141 of the Takeover Regulations…” 50.\nIn this regard I note that vide the above mentioned SEBI’s Order dated July 05 2016 the Anurag Agarwal and Paksh were directed to make a public announcement to acquire shares of SGWL in accordance with the provisions of SEBI SAST Regulations within a period of 45 days from the date of the said order and to pay along with the applicable consideration amount interest at the rate of 10% per Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited annum from December 26 2007 to the date of payment of consideration to the shareholders who were holding shares in the target company on the date of violation and whose shares are accepted in the open offer after adjustment of dividend paid if any.\nHowever the noticees therein failed to comply with the said directions and vide Adjudication Order dated May 31 2018 a penalty of Rs 2500000  was imposed on Anurag Agarwal and Paksh to be paid jointly and severally for the said noncompliance.\nFurther  Mr Anurag Agarwal is also alleged to have violated Regulation 131 and 134 of the PIT Regulations by No making disclosure as under i.\nReg. 131 Anurag Agarwal acquired more than 5% share capital 396800 shares i.e  9.2% on August 18 2005 but did No make any disclosure. ii.\nReg. 134 Anurag Agarwal was holding 196800 or 4.56% on May 24 2005.Then he further acquired 200000 shares more than 25000 shares on August 18 2005 and did No make any disclosure.\nRegulation 131 of the PIT Regulations inter alia provides that any person who holds more than 5% shares or voting rights in any listed company shall disclose to the company the number of shares or voting rights held by such person on becoming such holder within 2 working days of the acquisition of shares or voting rights.\nAs noted above Anurag Agarwal acquired more than 5% share capital 396800 shares i.e  9.2% on August 18 2005 but did No make any disclosure.\nMr Anurag Agarwal has also admitted in his statement dated July 12 2011 that he had No made any disclosures in respect of the same.\nHence it is abundantly clear that  Mr Anurag Agarwal failed to comply with the provisions of Regulation 131 of the PIT Regulations.\nAdjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited 53.\nFurther Regulation 134 of the PIT Regulations inter alia provides that any person who is a director of a listed company shall disclose to the company and the stock exchange where the securities are listed the total number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights if there has been a change in such holdings of such person and the change exceeds Rs 5 lakh in value or 25000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower.\nHowever no such disclosure was made and the same has been admitted by  Mr Anurag Agarwal in his statement.\nThus I find that  Mr Anurag Agarwal failed to comply with the provisions of Regulation 134 of the PIT Regulations.\nIn respect of the disclosure requirements and the PIT Regulations and compliance of the same during the course of the Adjudication Proceedings in contradiction to the statement of Anurag Agarwal dated July 12 2011 the AR has stated that Anurag Agarwal had informed the Company as per Regulation 131 and 134 of the PIT Regulations.\nCopies of the purported disclosures are also attached to the replies of Anuarg Agarwal dated September 28 2015.\nHowever surprisingly on perusal of the attachments submitted it is seen that same relate to sale of shares by Anurag Agarwal in 2009.\nOn the other hand the allegation pertains to the purchase of shares by Anurag Agarwal in 2005.\nHence it is evident that the submission made by the AR hold no merit.\nIn fact in his statement dated July 12 2011 also Anurag Agarwal had clearly stated that he had No made any disclosures at the time of purchase of the shares but had made the disclosures upon sale of shares.\nThus it is clear that Anurag Agarwal failed to comply with the provisions of Regulation 134 of the PIT Regulations as stated above.\nI therefore hold that  Mr Anurag Agarwal had violated Regulation 131 and 134 of the PIT Regulations and  Mr Anurag Agarwal and his PAC Paksh together have violated Regulation 71 and Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations 1997.\nAdjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited 56.\nIn light of the above paras the Noticees are liable for imposition of monetary penalties under sections 15Ab and 15H of the SEBI Act 1992 respectively which reads as under 15A.\nPenalty for failure to furnish information return etc. If any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made there under a.... b to file any return or furnish any information books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less.\nPenalty for No – disclosure of acquisition of shares and takeovers.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made there under fails to i......... ii make a public announcement to acquire shares at a minimum price; or iii......... he shall be liable to a penalty of twenty five crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of such failure whichever is higher.\nThe Honble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI vs  Shri Ram Mutual Funds [2006] 68 SCL 216 SC held that  once a violation of statutory regulation is established imposition of penalty becomes sine qua No of violation and the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes totally irrelevant.\nOnce the contravention is established then penalty is to follow.\nAdjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited 58.\nWhile determining the quantum of penalties under section 15Ab 15H and 15HA of the SEBI Act1992 it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of the SEBI Act1992 which reads as under 15J.\nWhile adjudging quantum of penalty under [15I or section 11 or section 11B the Board or the adjudicating officer] shall have due regard to the following factors namely — a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\n[Explanation.\n—For the removal of doubts it is clarified that the power 111[..] to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E clauses b and c of section 15F 15G 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.]\nI observe that from the material available on record it is difficult to quantify any gain or unfair advantage accrued to the Noticees or the extent of loss suffered by the investors as a result of the default of theNoticeesFurther the disclosures under the SAST and PIT Regulations mandating disclosure of acquisitions beyond certain quantity are to give equal treatment and opportunity to all shareholders and protect their interests.\nTo translate this objective into reality measures have been taken by SEBI to bring about transparency in the transactions and it is for this purpose that dissemination of such information is required.\nFailure to make disclosure within the stipulated time period provided in the regulation cannot be treated as trivial or of no consequence to be overlooked.\nAlso the violation of Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulation is a grave wrong.\nThe SAST Regulations mandates an acquirer to make a public announcement if the acquirer acquires 15% or more of the voting rights in a company.\nThis would provide an exit opportunity to the remaining shareholders at a specified price if they so desire in case of any new acquirer acquires substantial shareholding control in the company.\nBy failing to make the public announcement with respect to the said acquisition the investors and the shareholders at large were Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited denied of the opportunity to exit from the company.\nThe available records do No indicate the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticees or the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default.\nHowever the said default cannot be overlooked and is to be viewed seriously.\nIn view of the above after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and exercising the powers conferred upon me under Section 15I 2 of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules I hereby impose a a monetary penalty of Rs 150000 Rupees One Lakh Fifty Thousand Only each on Paksh Developers Private Limited and Shri.\nAnurag Agrwal thus a total of Rs 300000 Rupees Three Lakhs Only for nondisclosures under Regulation 71 of SAST Regulations and Rs 2500000 Rupees Twenty Five Lacs Only on Paksh Developers Private Limited and Shri.\nAnurag Agarwal payable jointly and severally for failure to make public announcement under Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations under Section 15H of the SEBI Act 1992 b monetary penalty of Rs 200000 Rupees Two Lakhs Only on Shri Anurag Agarwal for violation of Regulation 131 and 134 of PIT Regulations under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act 1992.\nThe Noticee shall remit pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order either by way of Demand Draft in favour of “SEBI  Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai OR through online payment facility available on the SEBI website www.sebi.gov.in on the following path by clicking on the payment link.\nAdjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited ENFORCEMENT Orders Orders of AO

Noticee was informed about the inspection date vide letter dated 04.10.2011 and was also advised to furnish a list of documents which the Noticee felt are some evidence which have been relied upon by SEBI and form the basis of charge in the SCN and the Noticee wanted to inspect.\nNoticee vide its letter dated 12.10.2011 furnished a list of documents that it wanted to inspect.\nNoticee vide its letter dated 08.11.2011 informed the previous AO Shri Parag Basu that it has filed consent application with SEBI in the given matter.\nIn the interest of natural justice and in order to conduct an inquiry in terms of rule 43 of the Adjudication Rules Shri D Ravikumar issued a hearing notice dated 24.09.2012 to the Noticeee advising the Noticee to submit its reply to the SCN on or before 15.10.2012 and attend the hearing in the matter on 22.10.2012 at SEBI Bhavan Mumbai.\nNoticee vide its letter dated 22.10.2012 stated that it has filed a consent application with SEBI on 08.11.2011 and the same was accordingly intimated to the AO on 08.11.2011.\nSince it has No heard either from the AO or any other SEBI authority in the matter it would request the AO No to proceed in the matter in any manner without giving it an opportunity of hearing.\nVide hearing notice dated 25.10.2012 the Noticee was granted another opportunity of hearing on 16.11.2012 at SEBI Bhavan Mumbai.\nFurther the Noticee was granted time till 09.11.2012 to submit a reply to the SCN.\nVide its letter dated 05.11.2012 Noticee replied to the SCN and inter alia made the following submissions “… Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd a 13.\nTill date SEBI has No provided RPIL with the relevant documents information upon which it has relied for the purpose of the allegation made in the SCN.\nThis demonstrates either that SEBI has no relevant or cogent information or material on the basis of which the allegations contained in the SCN have been made against RPIL or that the material if any in possession of SEBI does No support SEBI’s case.\nThe above principal was laid down by the Supreme Court in Narayan Govind v State of Maharashtra and Ors in the context of Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act 1872 where the Supreme court observed that “If some evidence is shown to exist on a question in issue but the party which has it within its power to produce it does not despite notice to do so produce it the natural presumption is that it would if produced have gone against it.\nSimilarly a presumption arises from a failure to discharge a special or particular onus.” b 14.\nIt is humbly submitted that as SEBI has failed to produce the documents evidence upon which it has based its statement in paragraph 10 of the SCN an adverse inference must be drawn against SEBI to the effect that had the same been placed on record the same would have destroyed the case of insider trading put forth by SEBI. c 15.\nWithout prejudice to the foregoing RPIL submits that the Securities Appellate Tribunal in Samir Arora v SEBI 2005 59 SCL 96 SAT has held that where activities like insider trading and fraudulent trade practices are concerned “charges must be proved based on cogent materials and in accordance with law.”\nThe SCN apart from mere surmises and conjectures has No furnished any cogent material to support the allegations of insider trading against RPIL. d 16.\nThe Supreme Court in the case of Anil Gilurker Vs Bilaspur Raipur Kshetria Gramin Bank and Anr [201110SCALE 465] has held that if a person is No told clearly and definitely what the allegations are on which the charges preferred against him are founded he cannot possibly by projecting his own imagination discover all the facts and circumstances Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd that may be in the contemplation of the authorities to be established against him. e 17.\nIn the case of Dilip S. Pendse vs  Securities and Exchange Board of India Appeal No 80 of 2009 decided on November 19 2009 the Securities Appellate Tribunal “SAT” has held that “the charge of insider trading is one of the most serious charges in relation to the securities market and having regard to the gravity of this wrong doing higher must be the preponderance of probabilities in establishing the same.” f 18.\nIn another case of market manipulation the seriousness of which is akin to a charge of insider trading being Nirmal Bang Securities P Ltd v SEBI [2004] 49 SCL 421 the SAT has held as follows “241.\nMarket manipulation being a serious charge the consequences that would visit the manipulation on proving the charge is quite harsh reasonably convincing evidence need be brought in to establish the charge.\nSurmises and conjectures are No enough.” g 19.\nRPIL will also refer to the following judgments in support of the above contentions i BPL Ltd v.\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India [2002] 38 SCL 310 SAT wherein the SAT has held that the allegations of a serious nature and cannot be based on surmises and conjectures. ii Videocon International v Securities and Exchange Board of India [2002] 4 Comp.\nLJ 402 SATMum where it has been held that SEBI must adduce sufficient evidence as a result of which a reasonable person acting reasonably and objectively may arrive at a finding upholding the alleged charges. iii Sterilite Industries India Limited v SEBI 2001 34 SCL 485 SATMUM SAT has held that evidence based on probabilities and endeavours to prove the fact on the basis of preponderance of probabilities is No sufficient to establish such a serious offence of market manipulation. h 20.\nFurther paragraph 10 of the SCN contains mere conjectures regarding the possession of unpublished price sensitive information by RPIL.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd i 20.1 The mere fact that  Mr K Sethuraman Group Company Secretary of RIL who was the contact person on behalf of RIL for interacting with legal advisors valuers and advisors for merger of IPCL with RIL made a representation to SEBI on behalf of RPIL when SEBI initiated enquiry into the Impugned Trades is no proof that RPIL would have had access to the First Alleged UPSI and Second Alleged UPSI.\nMr K Sethuraman was responsible for regulatory matters of all RIL group companies. j 20.2 That RPIL was conceived by the management of RIL for the sole purpose of acquiring IPCL shares at the time of disinvestment by the Government is no material or reason to conclude that RPIL was in possession of First Alleged UPSI and the Second Alleged UPSI. k 20.3 It was commonly known that RIL acquired IPCL and RPIL was the entity through which the acquisition was undertaken.\nIt is only natural that RIL or its wholly owned subsidiary will fund RPIL for its business needs including monies required for creeping acquisition of IPCL shares.\nThe funding of RPIL by RIL can in no way be treated as evidence direct or circumstantial to conclude that RPIL was in possession of First Alleged UPSI and the Second Alleged UPSI. l 20.4  Mr Ashok Jain an employee of RIL was the “Principal Officer” of RPIL under RBI’s NBFC Regulations.\nA certified copy of the extracts of board minutes of RPIL dated 25th April 2006 in this regard is annexed hereto and marked as “Annexure 2”.\nAs Principal Officer  Mr Ashok Jain was primarily responsible for the affairs of RPIL and was authorized to take decisions on behalf of RPIL.\nAlthough  Mr Ashok Jain was an employee of RIL his roles and responsibilities was limited to dealing with the affairs of RPIL and some other RIL group companies namely Reliance Chemicals Private Limited Reliance Polyolefins Private Limited Reliance Industrial Investments and Holding Limited Reliance Ventures Limited etc. Under such circumstances it is inconceivable that  Mr Ashok Jain would have been privy or to be reasonably expected to have knowledge of First Alleged UPSI and Second Alleged UPSI which are corporate decisions taken at the highest management level of IPCL and RIL.\nMr Ashok Jain was authorised Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd by the Board of RPIL to make investments upto the limits allowed under the Board resolution from time to time.\nOn 25th April 2006  Mr Jain was specifically authorised by a resolution of the board of directors of RPIL to invest up to 30 crores in the equity shares of IPCL.\nThe minutes of this board meeting clearly indicate that RPIL had made a decision to commence creeping acquisition of IPCL shares.\nAnnexed hereto and marked as “Annexure 3” is a copy of the extract of board minutes dated 25th April 2006.\nThis limit was almost exhausted in June 2006.\nThereafter on 4th January 2007 the Board of RPIL once again resolved to further acquire IPCL shares up to additional 100 crores.\nAnnexed hereto and marked as “Annexure 4” is a copy of the extract of board minutes dated 4th January 2007.\nThus it can be seen that RPIL commenced acquiring IPCL shares in accordance with the Takeover Regulations upto the limits permitted therein In such circumstances it is submitted that the subsequent trading in the shares of IPCL by RPIL in February March 2007 was implementation of the aforementioned decision evidenced through clear board resolutions which decision was taken much in advance prior to the existence of the First Alleged UPSI or the Second Alleged UPSI.\nTherefore in such circumstances it cannot be contended that merely because RPIL traded in close proximity to the dates for announcement of declaration or a merger of IPCL RPIL traded on the basis of unpublished price sensitive information. m 20.5  Mr Ashok Jain from time to time took decisions to purchase shares of IPCL.\nIt was after these resolutions in April 2006 and January 2007 that  Mr Ashok Jain started purchasing shares of IPCL from May 2006 and thereafter in February March 2007.\nIt is again reiterated that  Mr Ashok Jain at no time had access to any unpublished price sensitive information and the purchases of IPCL by him for and on behalf of RPIL were for the purpose of creeping acquisitions which acquisition decisions were taken by the board of directors of RPIL in April 2006 and January 2007.\nThe mere fact that Ashok Jain was an employee of RIL cannot in anyway Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd substantiate the charge that RPIL was in possession of First Alleged UPSI and the Second Alleged UPSI. n 20.6… It is submitted that during the period May – June 2006 RPIL purchased about 12 lakhs shares of IPCL at prices at around 205 to 220 per share.\nThereafter the share prices of IPCL started increasing and it touched even 325 per share.\nThereafter the price starting witnessing a downward trend and settled at around 250 to 260 per share.\nBetween July 2006 to February 2007 the price was in the range of 255 to 325.\nIt was only in the third week of February 2007 the price witnessed a fall to around 250 and it was decided to purchase further quantity towards creeping acquisition.\nShare price movement showing the above details is annexed hereto marked as “Annexure 5”.\nAs can be seen it was No for the first time that RPIL purchased the shares of IPCL on 27th February 2007.\nThe decision to commence Purchase of IPCL shares in February 2007 was because of the aforementioned reasons and this act cannot lead one to believe or allege that RPIL was in possession of the First Alleged UPSI and the Second Alleged UPSI. o 21.\nIt is submitted that no inference of the nature sought to be drawn in the SCN from the facts specified therein can be drawn.\nThe SCN fails to provide any material to establish the fact that RPIL obtained any socalled UPSI from RIL or any other person.\nThe burden falls squarely on SEBI to establish that the unpublished price sensitive information was relied upon by RPIL to execute the Relevant Trades. p 22.\nRPIL submits that the acquisition of shares in IPCL was a part of creeping acquisition of IPCL which was under its control and that there is absolutely no basis for the allegations set out in the SCN.\nRPIL acquired shares under the creeping limits prescribed by the erstwhile Takeover Regulations No only in the impugned period but also during May – June 2006 in order to consolidate its holding in IPCL.\nThe Securities Appellate Tribunal in Samir Arora V SEBI 2005 59 SCL 96 SAT has held that there could be a prima facie presumption of Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd being an ‘insider’ once both the conditions in the definition of ‘insider ’are met with.\nThus persons can be treated as insiders only if they have received price sensitive information or have had in fact access to such information.\nIt was also held that “the fact of such connected or deemed to be connected persons having received information will have to be established by evidence satisfying reasonable standard of proof.” r 26.\nFurther it is submitted that the SCN has No placed any material on record to prove the allegations made against RPIL even by using a lower quality of evidence to satisfy the standard of a preponderance of probabilities.\nDastane – AIR 1975 SC 1534 at page 1539 para 24  Hansraj Gupta v.\nDehra Dun – Mussoorie Electric Tramway Co. Ltd – AIR 1940 PC 98 at page 99 para C2  Imperial Corporation Financial Services Pvt Ltd v SEBI – Appeal No 56 2003 Date of decision July 30 2004 at page 7 para 21 … s 28.\nAccordingly it is submitted that SEBI has failed to discharge the burden of proof or the standard of proof incumbent upon it in order to sustain a charge of insider trading.\nThus it is submitted that RPIL is No and cannot be said to have violated Regulation 3 of the PIT Regulations as alleged or otherwise.\nIn the circumstances RPIL submits that the SCN and all proceedings against RPIL emanating therefrom are liable to be dropped. t 29.\nFIRST ALLEGED UPSI No IN EXISTENCE AT THE TIME OF RELEVANT TRADES u 29.1. RPIL has ascertained the following facts i On 28th February 2007 the Union Budget contained a proposal to enhance the dividend distribution tax from 12.5% to 15% for dividends payable on and from 1st April 2007. ii In view of the above proposal to declare and pay interim dividend by IPCL was mooted by  Mr S. K Anand Wholetime Director of IPCL on 2nd March 2007;\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd iii Accordingly  Mr K Sethuraman Vice President – Corporate Secretarial of RIL informed the stock exchanges about the proposed board meeting on 10th March 2007 for consideration of payment of interim dividend. iv The information regarding proposed declaration of interim dividend by IPCL was known only to  Mr Mukesh Ambani  Mr K Sethuraman and  Mr S.K Anad and Ms.Sasikala Rao and was No known to anyone else prior to the notification to stock exchange by IPCL on 2nd March 2007. v 29.2 IPCL closed its trading window as per its Insider Trading Code only on 2nd March 2007 which closure continued till 24 hours after 10th March 2007 date of Board Meeting of IPCL declaring interim dividend and approving the amalgamation of IPCL and RIL.\nGiven that the trading window had got shut on 2nd March 2007 when the UPSI being the proposal for interim dividend came into existence there was no requirement to shut the trading window again for the second UPSI being the proposed merger.\nThis fact clearly demonstrates that even according to IPCL no unpublished price sensitive information regarding declaration of interim dividends existed prior to the corporate announcement made on 2nd March 2007. w 29.3.\nThe aforesaid facts clearly prove that the First Alleged UPSI was No in existence on February 2007 and 1st March 2007. x 29.4.\nIt is submitted that i.\nThe First Alleged UPSI came into existence only on 2nd March 2007; ii.\nThe persons responsible and who were involved in the process have affirmed that the First Alleged UPSI was treated as confidential and was known only to select people connected therewith;\nNo connection has been drawn in the SCN between such persons and the relevant person at RPIL who executed the trades in IPCL.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd iii.\nThere is no question of the relevant person at RPIL having knowledge of or being in possession of the First Alleged UPSI while carrying out the Relevant Trades.\nSECOND ALLEGED UPSI No IN EXISTENCE AT THE TIME OF RELEVANT TRADES z 31.1. RPIL has ascertained the following facts i The proposal for the merger of IPCL with RIL was for the first time considered only on 4th March 2007 ii The proposal was known to only select top executives of IPCL and RIL and was kept confidential iii The valuers’ and financial advisors were appointed only on or after 5th March 2007 Please find annexed copies of engagement letters issued by IPCL and RIL to the valuers advisors marked collectively as “Annexure 6”. aa 31.2 The aforesaid facts clearly prove that the Second Alleged UPSI was No in existence while carrying out the Relevant Trades. bb 31.3 It is submitted that i.\nThe Second Alleged UPSI came into existence only on 4th 5th March 2007; ii.\nThe persons responsible and who were involved in the process have affirmed that the Second Alleged UPSI was treated as confidential and was known only to select people connected therewith; iii.\nThere is no question of the relevant persons at RPIL who made the investment decision to acquire IPCL shares having knowledge of or being in possession of the Second Alleged UPSI while carrying out the Relevant Trades.\nAccordingly contrary to the allegations in the SCN the relevant person at RPIL who made the investment decisions could No have conceivably Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd been in possession of the First Alleged UPSI and Second Alleged UPSI while carrying out the Relevant Trades.\nIt is expressly declared that RPIL and IPCL are No companies deemed to be under the same management as per Section 370 1B of the Companies Act 1956.\nIt is submitted that the allegations against RPIL in this regard set forth in the SCN are incorrect and deserve to be rejected for the following reasons which are all in the alternative and without prejudice to each other ee 37.\nTwo bodies corporate are deemed to be under the same management under sub clause i a of Section 370 1B of the Companies Act 1956 if the managing agent secretaries and treasurers managing director or manager of one body is the same as that of the other.\nIn this case  Mr Mukesh Ambani is the Managing Director only of RIL and does No occupy any of the above mentioned positions in IPCL.\nHe was a non executive chairman of IPCL.\nHowever the SCN sets out that  Mr Mukesh Ambani is the Chairman of both IPCL and RIL.\nIn this regard it is important to note that this Section will No be attracted in an instance where the position of Chairman of the two bodies corporate is occupied by the same person.\nIt is thus abundantly clear that the SCN has failed to establish that  Mr Mukesh Ambani occupies any of the statutorily enumerated positions as per Section 370 1B i a of the Companies Act 1956 in both IPCL and RIL.\nTherefore the condition in Section 370 1B i a of the Companies Act 1956 IPCL and RIL cannot be said to be under the same management on this ground. ff 38.\nTwo bodies corporate are deemed to be under the same management under sub clause ii of Section 370 1B of the Companies Act 1956 if within the six months immediately preceding the directors of one body constitute a majority on the board of the other body.\nIt is submitted that the Board of Directors of RIL for the financial years 200607 and 200708 comprised of the following individuals respectively;\nDirector of RPIL during 200607 Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd 1.\nJyotindra H. Thacker 2.\nArjun Vasant Bet\nar 3.\nVenkatachalam Subramaniam Director of RPIL during 200708 1.\nJyotindra H. Thacker 2.\nArjun Vasant Bet\nar 3.\nVenkatachalam Subramaniam 4.\nP.M.S Prasad appointed on 24.03.2008 5.\nB.K Gangopadhyay appointed on 24.03.2008 None of the Directors of RPIL were on the Board of IPCL during the F.Y. 200607 and 200708.\nThus it is evident that the directors of RIPL did No constitute a majority on the board of IPCL or vice versa as there was no overlap in the directorships of the two companies. gg 39.\nTwo bodies corporate are deemed to be under the same management under sub clause iii of Section 370 1B if No less than onethird of the total voting power relating to each of the two bodies corporate is exercised or controlled by the same individual or body corporate.\nFor this condition to be satisfied it is No sufficient to allege that one body corporate merely holds more than one third of the total voting power in another body corporate.\nIt is imperative to establish that the same individual or body corporate holds more than a third of the voting rights with the respect to both the companies being examined for the purposes of this clause. hh 40.\nIn this case the only SCN alleges the following  First that IPCL and RIL are deemed to be under the same management because RPIL holds more than one –third of the total voting power of IPCL.\nSecond that RIL and RPIL are deemed to be under the same management because RIL holds the entire share capital of RPIL through two of its wholly owned subsidiaries. ii 41.\nAt no point is the SCN able to establish a connection between RPIL and IPCL by way of a common individual or body corporate holding more than one third of the voting rights in both the companies.\nThus given the Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd requirements under sub clause iii of Section 370 1B the allegation is incorrect and in no way prove that RPIL and IPCL are under the same management. jj 42.\nTwo bodies corporate are deemed to be under the same management under sub clause iv of Section 370 1B if the holding company of one body corporate is under the same management as the other within the purview of sub clauses i ii or iii of Section 370 1B.\nIn light of the above mentioned submissions RPIL is No under the same management as IPCL.\nIt is submitted that Regulation 3 and 3A of the PIT Regulations seek to prohibit the same offence.\nWhilst Regulation 3 of the PIT Regulations prohibits “insiders” Regulation 3A of the PIT Regulations prohibits companies in possession of UPSI.\nIt is submitted that all companies in possession of UPSI are in fact “insiders” and therefore irrespective of the charge being under Regulation 3 or Regulation 3A of the PIT Regulations the defences under Regulation 3B of the PIT Regulation are available to RPIL. ll 48.\nClauses 1 and 2 of Regulation 3B of the PIT Regulations provide defences to a company referred to under Regulation 3A.\nIt is submitted that since the scope of the prohibition under Regulation 3 and Regulation 3A is the same when a company in this case RPIL is charged with the offence of insider trading under Regulation 3 instead of Regulation 3A the defences available under Regulation 3B of the PIT Regulations are also available to such company. mm 49.Without prejudice to the contention above that the First Alleged UPSI and Second Alleged UPSI did No exist at the time of the Relevant Trades it is submitted that assuming for the sake of argument that the UPSI did exist the defence available under Regulation 3B 1 of the PIT Regulations is available to RPIL. nn 50.\nIn the present case as stated above it is submitted that the decision to execute the Relevant Trades was taken by  Mr Ashok Jain with the only Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd objective of acquiring IPCL shares under creeping route to increase the holding in IPCL which was already under the control of RPIL for which he was duly authorized by the board of directors.\nAs the Minutes of the Board Meeting would justify the authority for investments in equity and other securities was provided to  Mr Ashok Jain primarily for creeping acquisition of IPCL shares.\nThe persons who were part of the decisions making process and who were privy regarding the information with respect of interim dividend and merger of IPCL with RIL had no interaction with  Mr Ashok Jain who took the decision in the normal course for creeping acquisition IPCL shares.\nIt is submitted that RPIL was a registered nonbanking finance company and RIL does No control the daytoday operations business strategies or business or policy decisions of RPIL.\nNeither did the concerned person within RPIL who executed the relevant trades receive information or updates regarding the daytoday business decision and plans of IPCL.\nThus concerned persons within RPIL who executed the Relevant Trades did No have any access to No could reasonably be expected to have access to the unpublished price sensitive information in relation to the proposed amalgamation of the Company. pp 53.\nFrom the above it is evident that the person who took the decision on behalf of RPIL to execute the Impugned Trades had no access to the UPSI No could reasonably be expected to have access to the UPSI.\nThe SCN does No provide any material other than surmises and conjectures to establish the contrary.\nWithout prejudice to the contention above that the First Alleged UPSI and Second Alleged UPSI did No exist at the time of the Relevant Trades it is submitted that the acquisition of IPCL shares by RPIL was as per the erstwhile Takeover Regulations under the creeping route applicable to “promoters and persons acting in concert” and within the limits prescribed therein.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd rr 57.\nIn view of the defence available under Regulation 3B2 of the PIT Regulations without prejudice to any of the other contentions in these submissions RPIL cannot be held guilty of violation of insider trading regulations. ss 58.\nAs stated hereinabove RPIL has made the impugned investments with a view to increase its holding in IPCL and no other ulterior motive as suggested by SEBI.\nThe Relevant Trades were in furtherance of the acquisition plan in the normal course of business and were No executed on the basis of any unpublished price sensitive information as alleged or otherwise.\nIn fact the impugned investments were No disposed off before the record date for the merger and RIL shares were received postmerger by RPIL.\nRPIL thereafter has transferred these shares to another company within Reliance Group.\nThus RPIL purchased 1198457 shares of IPCL during the period of May – June 2006.\nFurther acquisitions of 2132953 shares of IPCL were completed during FebruaryMarch 2007 which were again motivated by the intent of creeping acquisition and could No have been based on any unpublished price sensitive information. uu 61.\nThe Securities Appellate Tribunal in a recent order passed on January 31 2012 in the case of Mrs. Chandrakala v SEBI has held in paragraph 7 that the prerequisite of insider trading is trading or dealing in securities on the basis of unpublished price sensitive information i.e  “the trades executed should be motivated by the information in the possession of the insider or that the information in possession of the insider should be the factor or circumstance that has induced him to trade in the scrip of the company.\nIt is only then that RPIL will be said to have dealt with or traded “on the basis of” that information.\nThus RPIL submits that it has No violated Regulation 3 of the PIT Regulations.\n…” Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd 10.\nNoticee vide its letter dated 05.11.2012 requested to prepone the date of hearing

ARs further stated that there was no commonality between IPCL and RIL and that Shri Mukesh Ambani was non executive chairman of IPCL.\nWhen queried as to whether the company IPCL does No fall under the same group the ARs stated that this point was No raised in the SCN and therefore the ARs will give a separate submission in this regard.\nARs further submitted that IPCL and RPIL do No fall under Section 370 1B of the Companies Act and therefore it is No applicable.\nARs further clarified that RPIL bought only 0.54% shares of IPCL by creeping acquisition.\nShri Ashok C Jain was authorized to make the creeping acquisition by IPCL.\nARs further submitted that the proposal of merger was first discussed on 04.03.2007 and the valuers were appointed on 05.03.2007.

12.\nNoticee vide its letter dated 19.11.2012 made additional written submissions wherein inter alia it made the following submissions “… a 5.\nWe submit that RPIL and IPCL are No companies under the same group as per the definition of “Group” under the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1969.\nAs per the definition of “Group” two bodies corporate are deemed to be under the same group if both the bodies corporate exercise or is established to be in a position to exercise control directly or indirectly over any body corporate firm or trust i.e  a third entity.\nIt is submitted that RPIL and IPCL do No collectively exercise any direct or indirect control over a third entity.\nTherefore RPIL and IPCL are No companies under the same “Group” as per the definition under Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1969.\nTherefore it follows that RPIL is No “a deemed connected person” to IPCL.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd b 6.\nWithout prejudice to the above explanation we reiterate i that there is no allegation in the Show Cause Notice that RPIL is a deemed connected person under Regulation 2hi of the PIT Regulations due to the fact that RPIL and IPCL are companies under the same group as per Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1969 and ii that SEBI at this stage of the proceedings cannot bring a new allegation.\nIt is submitted that at the belated stage of a personal hearing in the matter SEBI cannot be permitted to raise any fresh allegations and the same is clearly in violation of well settled principles of law and the principles of natural justice.\nIn this situation it is unfair to expect RPIL to advance arguments and defend itself against additional grounds raised only at the time of hearing because such a practice by SEBI is a violation of principles of natural justice and prevents RPIL from being given a fair trial..\n…” PREVIOUS ADJUDICATION ORDER AND ORDER BY HON”BLE SECURITIES APPLLATE TRIBUNAL 13.\nAn adjudication order dated 02.05.2013 was passed in the matter by the previous AO Shri D Ravikumar.\nThe said order was challenged by the Noticee before Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal hereinafter referred to as ‘SAT’.\nIn the appeal no 122 of 2013 Hon’ble SAT vide its Order dated 07.12.2015 has interalia observed as follows “ … 4.\nOn perusal of para 9 and 10 of the impugned order it is seen that apart from denying that the Appellant was an insider Appellant had placed on record various documents to rebut the presumption of being in possession of UPSI at the time of purchasing shares and the Appellant had also made submission to the effect that the price sensitive information itself came into existence after the shares were purchased by the Appellant.\nNeither the documents furnished have been considered No the arguments advanced on behalf of the Appellant have been considered in the impugned order.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd 5.\nSince the impugned order is passed merely on the basis of presumption without considering the arguments advanced on behalf of the Appellant to rebut the presumption the impugned order is quashed and set aside and the matter is restored to the file of Adjudicating Officer of SEBI for passing fresh order on merits and in accordance with law.\nSince the Appellant has already deposited the amount of penalty with SEBI Adjudicating Officer of SEBI is directed to hear the Appellant and pass fresh order on merits in accordance with law within 3 months from today.\nAll contentions are kept open.\nThe amount of penalty deposited will be subject to the result of the fresh order that is to be passed by SEBI.”\nCURRENT ADJUDICATION PROCEEDINGS 14.\nPursuant

Facts 18.1 3 A brief summary of the facts in the above matter is as under a Pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated May 21 2002 with the Government of India RPIL acquired 64538662 shares of IPCL from Government of India constituting 26% of the total voting capital of IPCL.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd Thereafter on 24th July 2002.\nRPIL made an open cash offer to the existing shareholders of IPCL in compliance with the then applicable SEBI substantial Acquisition of shares and Takeover Regulations 1997 to acquire upto a further stake of 20% of the shareholding of IPCL.\nUpon the close of the said open offer RPIL held 46% stake in IPCL. b RPIL passed a resolution dated April 25 2006 authorising  Mr A.V Bet\nar  Mr Jyotindra Thacker and  Mr Subramaniam Directors of RPIL and  Mr Ashok C. Jain Authorized Signatory of RPIL to invest 30 crores by acquiring equity shares of IPCL.\nThis was a commercial decision taken by RPIL which already held a major stake in the shareholding of IPCL since 2002.\n… e On January 4 2007 in line with its commercial decision to invest in IPCL  RPIL passed another resolution authorizing the aforesaid persons to make additional investments upto 100 Crore in the equity shares of IPCL. f On February 22 2007 the price of the shares of IPCL fell from 270.30 to 262.70 thereby bringing the shares into the price range at which RPIL was agreeable to invest more money into IPCL.\n… k On March 2 2007  Mr S.K. Anand a wholetime director of IPCL advised Ms. Shashikala Rao Company Secretary of IPCL and  Mr Sethuraman to call a board meeting of IPCL to consider declaration of interim dividend.\nAs per recollection of  Mr Sethuraman  Mr S. K Anand’s advice to convene a board meeting for considering declaration of interim dividend was acted upon and was intimated to stock exchanges within a couple of hours. l At this stage we may clarify that  Mr K. Sethuraman was the Vice President Corporate Secretarial for RIL.\nIn performance of his duties in RIL  Mr Sethuraman also oversaw the secretarial activities of the subsidiaries and associate companies of RIL.\n… n in this regard we may point out the following Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd i The orders to purchase 98280 shares of IPCL were placed by RPIL at 1024 am on March 22007; ii The corporate announcement of the board meeting of IPCL to consider the declaration of interim dividend was made at 228 pm on March 2 2007 and had been made within a couple of hours after the discussion between  Mr S.K. Anand and  Mr Sethuraman in accordance with the requirements of Clause 36 of the Listing Agreement.\nThe said board meeting was scheduled to take place on March 10 2007 … o The Proposal for a possible merger of RIL and IPCL was considered and discussed for the first time in a meeting among  Mr Mukesh Ambani  Mr Alok Agarwal RIL Chief Financial Officer and  Mr L.V Merchant RIL Controller Accounts on March 4 2007. p On March 5 2007 the steps for initiating the discussion regarding the proposed merger were taken.\nIn line with the same. i JM Morgan Stanley were appointed as a financial advisor by way of an engagement letter dated March 5 2007 ii PricewaterhouseCoopers “PwC” were appointed as an independent valuer for the proposed amalgamation by way of an engagement letter dated March 5 2007 and iii Ernst & Young “E&Y” were appointed as joint valuers for the proposed amalgamation by way of an engagement letter dated March 5 2007. q On March 7 2007 IPCL made a corporate announcement at 515 pm stating that it will consider and recommend amalgamation of IPCL with RIL at the upcoming board meeting on March 10 2007. r DSP Merrill Lynch were appointed as the joint financial advisor for the proposed amalgamation on March 5 2007. s At the meeting of the board of directors of IPCL on March 10 2007 the proposal for declaration of interim dividend was considered and approved by the board of directors of IPCL.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd t A joint meeting of the boards of directors of RIL and IPCL also took place on March 10 2007 where a joint report of E&Y and PwC was submitted setting out the recommendation of a swap ratio in the event that a merger took place between RIL and IPCL.\nThe joint financial advisers also presented their views on the proposed merger.\nIn view of the same the boards of directors of RIL and IPCL approved the merger at their respective Board meetings.\nC. Rationale for Relevant Trades 18.2 4.\nRPIL had invested into the shares of IPCL in 2002 as a commercial decision.\nIn line with that decision RPIL was investing further into IPCL by purchasing its shares on the stock market on a creeping basis in accordance with the provisions of the SEBI Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover Regulations ‘Takeover Regulations’ applicable at the time.\nHowever commercially RPIL was only willing to invest into the shares of IPCL as long as they were at a certain price.\nIt is for this reason that at the meeting of the board of directors of RPIL on April 25 2006 the board authorized  Mr A. V Bet\nar  Mr Jyotindra Thacker and  Mr Subramaniam Directors of RPIL and  Mr Ashok C. Jain authorized signatory of RPIL to invest 30 crores by acquiring equity shares of IPCL.\nThe minutes of this board meeting clearly indicate that RPIL had made a decision to commence creeping acquisition of IPCL shares.\nAnnexed hereto and marked as “Annexure 4” is a copy of the extract of board minutes dated April 25 2006.\nThereafter RPIL purchased approximately 12 lakh shares of IPCL at 205 Rs 220 per share between May to June of 2006.\nThe investment limit agreed to in the board meeting on April 25 2006 was almost exhausted in June 2006.\nThereafter the share prices of IPCL started increasing and it even touched 325 per share as a result of which further shares were No purchased.\nFrom July 2006 to February 2007 the price of the shares of IPCL was in the range of 255 to 325.\nMeanwhile the board of directors of RPIL in its meeting on January 4 2007 once again resolved to invest a further sum of 100 Crore to purchase the share of IPCL on a creeping basis.\nIn the third Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd week of February the price of the shares of IPCL fell to approximately 250 thereby bringing the shares into the price range at which RPIL was agreeable to invest.\nAnnexed hereto and marked as “Annexure 5” is a copy of the extract of board minutes dated January 4 2007.\nThe share price movement of IPCL showing the above details is annexed hereto and marked as “Annexure 6”.\nIt is therefore submitted that the Relevant Trades did No take place abruptly but the shares in question were purchased on the basis of the price of the shares of IPCL and in line with the commercial decision taken by RPIL.\nIt is submitted that the past trading pattern of RPIL in the shares of IPCL ought to have been taken into consideration by the SEBI in considering whether the Relevant Trades were conducted on the basis of UPSI.\nIn this context the case of Manoj Gaur v.\nSEBI Appeal No 64 of 2012 decided on October 3 2012 may be taken into consideration where the trading pattern was analysed by the Securities Appellate Tribunal in reaching a finding that it was highly improbable that trading was done on the basis of UPSI.\nD. No Existence of UPSI 18.7 9.\nIt is pertinent to take note of the following a The SCN does No specify that i. the First Alleged UPSI existed any time prior to March 2 2007 and ii. the Second Alleged UPSI existed any time prior to March 4 2007. b SEBI has No produced any material to show when the First Alleged UPSI or the Second Alleged UPSI came into existence. c As against this there is voluminous evidence including in the form of affidavits to show that the First Alleged UPSI was No in existence prior to March 2 2007 and that the Second Alleged UPSI was No in existence prior to March 4 2007.\nIt is submitted that the First Alleged UPSI and the Second Alleged UPSI were No in existence at the time of the Relevant Trades.\n… 18.8 12 Without prejudice to the above assuming without admitting that the First Alleged UPSI and or Second Alleged UPSI have been in existence prior to any of the Relevant Trades it is submitted that  Mr Ashok C. Jain who was executing RPIL’s decision to purchase the shares of IPCL could No have Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd been aware of the alleged UPSI.\nThe discussion in respect of the First Alleged UPSI and or Second Alleged UPSI took place only amongst the senior most executives of IPCL and RIL and was No disclosed to any person in RPIL as has been stated in the affidavits forming part of Annexure 7 and Annexure 8.\n9 13 Without further prejudice to the above RPIL states that there is nothing on record to establish or even indicate that the First Alleged UPSI and or Second Alleged UPSI were in existence prior to the execution of the Relevant Trades and if so there is also nothing on record to show that RPIL entered into the Relevant Trades in the shares of IPCL on the basis of the First Alleged UPSI and or Second Alleged UPSI.\n10 14 In its order passed in Mrs. Chandrakala v SEBI on January 31 2012 the Securities Appellate Tribunal found that the prerequisite to a charge of insider trading is to show that trading took place on the basis of unpublished price sensitive information i.e  that the trades took place on the basis of or being motivated by the information in the possession of the insider.\nIn the present case it has been demonstrated and established that the First Alleged UPSI and or Second Alleged UPSI were No in existence at the time of the execution of the Relevant Trades and without prejudice to the same should the UPSI have been in existence it could No have been in the possession of  Mr Ashok C. Jain who placed the trades on behalf of RPIL.\nE. RPIL is No an “Insider” 18.11 15 RPIL is No an “insider” as defined in Regulation 2e of PIT Regulations.\nRegulation 2e of the PIT Regulations stipulate that an ‘insider’ is a person who a is or was connected with the company or is deemed to have been connected with the company AND is reasonably expected to have access to unpublished price sensitive information in respect of securities of a company;\nOR b has received or has had access to such unpublished price sensitive information.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd RPIL is No a person ‘deemed to be connected’ within the meaning of Regulation 2h of the PIT Regulations.\n… 18.12 c Section 3701B iii of the companies Act 1956 Two bodies corporate are deemed to be under the same management under subclause iii of section 3701B of the Companies Act 1956 if No less than onethird of the total voting power relating to each of the two bodies corporate is exercised or controlled by the same individual or body corporate.\nFor this condition to be satisfied it is No sufficient to allege that one body corporate merely holds more than one third of the total voting power in another body corporate.\nOn the other hand it is imperative to establish that the same individual or body corporate holds more than a third of the voting rights with respect to both the companies being examined for the purposes of this clause.\nIn this regard it is submitted that i.\nRIL did No exercise any voting power in RPIL directly as is evident from the shareholding pattern of RPIL during the financial year 200607 which has been annexed hereto and marked as “Annexure 9”. ii.\nFurther the Ministry of Corporate Affairs Department Circular No.15 31CLVI 62 dated July 20 1962 “MCA Circular” deals with the interpretation of the expression “the same individual or body corporate” occurring in clause iii of sub section 1B of section 370 of the Companies Act 1956 and lays down that this expression implies singular number only and No plural.\nAs is evident from the shareholding pattern set out in Annexure 9 RIL as a single entity did No directly hold the requisite onethird shares in RPIL as the shareholding of RPIL was crossheld by a number of subsidiaries.\nThe onethird voting right in RPIL were exercised by RVL and No by RIL. iii.\nTo summarise 1st. for the requirement to be satisfied a triangular corporate structure is contemplated where one entity namely “A” should Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd hold shares in two entities namely “B” and “C” for “B” and “C” to be “companies under the same management”.\n“A and c” or “A and B” are never “companies under the same management” in absence of any other relationship contemplated under section 370 1B of the Companies Act 1956.\n3rd. admittedly RIL does No even hold shares in RPIL and does No fulfil requirement of triangular structure.\n4th. there is no single entity which holds shares in the other two entities. iv Further the composition of the board of directors of the intermediary companies was also different which establishes that all the companies were being managed by distinct and separate entities.\nThe composition of the board of directors during 200607 of all the intermediary companies is annexed hereto and marked as “Annexure 10” collectively.\nFrom Annexures 9 and 10 it is clear that neither did any single entity have the right to control the board of directors of RPIL No did it exercise or control more than half of the total voting power of RPIL.\nConsequently RPIL was No a subsidiary of RIL.\nTherefore the allegation that IPCL and RPIL were “companies under the same management” is factually and legally incorrect. v Further IPCL is a separate legal entity with its own independent management and this is evident from the composition of the boards of RIL and IPCL.\nAt the relevant time out of a board of ten members of IPCL only two board members were common with RIL being  Mr Mukesh Ambani and  Mr Nikhil Meswani and the same cannot be said to constitute control over 50% of the board of IPCL. vi Since RIL did No exercise or control at least onethird voting power of RPIL and IPCL RPIL and IPCL cannot be deemed to be under the same management as defined under Section 370 1B iii of the Companies Act 1956.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd … F. Without prejudice RPIL could No have violated the PIT Regulations ............. 18.13.\nTherefore as per the decision in Rajiv Gandhi’s Case Supra the presumption of being in possession of UPSI is rebuttable on the basis that an insider is able to show that he did No trade on the basis of UPSI.\nAssuming without admitting that RPIL is a an insider it has established by cogent evidence that i. the Relevant Trades were undertaken pursuant to the decision in 2006 and 2007 to invest further in IPCL on a creeping basis as long as the price of the shares of IPCL were below a certain price. ii.\nUPSI was No in existence at the time of the undertaking of the Relevant Trades iii.\nAssuming without admitting that the alleged UPSI was in existence the discussions in respect of the UPSI took place at the level of the senior most management of RIL and IPCL while the trading of RPIL was being conducted by  Mr Ashok C. Jain who had no access whatsoever to the UPSI.\nThus without prejudice to the submission that the alleged UPSI was No in existence at the time that the Relevant Trades were executed it is submitted that RPIL has rebutted the presumption of being in possession of the alleged UPSI at the time of executing the Relevant Trades.\nThere is also nothing on record or in the SCN to say otherwise.\nIn view of the same the aforementioned presumption must No and cannot be made against RPIL.\nIn any event RPIL is No an insider.\n………………………” 19.\nVide office note hereinafter also referred to as “ON office note” dated 27.01.2016 certain information documentary evidence were sought from the concerned department hereinafter referred to as “OD”.\nOD vide its office note dated 01.02.2016 replied to the aforesaid office note dated 27.01.2016 Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd along with copies of documents in the matter.\nHowever after perusal of its reply it was noted that certain information documents which were sought were No furnished.\nHence the same were once again sought from OD on 02.02.2016.\nIn response to the same OD vide its office note dated 03.02.2016 provided certain documents in the matter.\nThe documents and comments of OD have been referred in the subsequent part of this order.\nAfter perusal of the material available on record I have the following issues for consideration viz.\nA.

What quantum of monetary penalty should be imposed on the Noticee if the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under Section 15G of the SEBI Act?\nFINDINGS 21.\nOn perusal of the material available on record and giving regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and submissions of the Noticee I record my findings hereunder.\nISSUE A Whether the two announcements made by IPCL were PSI?\nAccording to the investigation report hereinafter referred to as ‘IR’ Noticee made the following two announcements Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd Date Time Announcement 02Mar 2007 1428 To consider inter alia declaration of Interim Dividend on equity shares of the Company.\nThe Company further informed the Exchange that the Company has fixed March 22 2007 as Record Date to determine the equity shareholders who would be eligible to receive the Interim Dividend if declared by the Board at its meeting scheduled on March 10 2007.\nIn the event of the Board deciding to pay Interim Dividend the Company shall commence dispatch of the Dividend Warrants on and from March 23 2007.\n07Mar 2007 1715 To consider inter alia declaration of Interim Dividend on equity shares of the Company.\nThe Company has No informed the Exchange that the Board will also consider and recommend amalgamation of the Company with Reliance Industries Limited.\nRegulation 2 ha of PIT Regulations read as under ha “price sensitive information” means any information which relates directly or indirectly to a company and which if published is likely to materially affect the price of securities of company.\nExplanation.—The following shall be deemed to be price sensitive information — iperiodical financial results of the company; ii intended declaration of dividends both interim and final; iii issue of securities or buyback of securities; iv any major expansion plans or execution of new projects. v amalgamation mergers or takeovers; vi disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking; vii and significant changes in policies plans or operations of the company;\nOn a perusal of explanation to Regulation 2 ha of PIT Regulations which defines “deemed price sensitive information” it is noted that ‘intended declaration of dividends both interim and final’ and ‘amalgamation mergers or takeovers’ are deemed PSI.\nFrom the IR I note that after IPCL made announcement of its board meeting to consider the declaration of interim dividend on 02.03.2007 the price of IPCL share on that day on BSE closed at 256.70 from the previous close of Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd 260.40 on 01.03.2007. Further the price of the share closed at 237.40 on 05.03.2007. 26.\nI also note from the IR that IPCL made announcement of consideration and recommendation of amalgamation of IPCL with RIL on 07.03.2007 after the close of trading hours.\nThe price of IPCL share on BSE closed at 259.80 on 08.03.2007 from the previous close of 231.65 on 07.03.2007. 27.\nI also note from the IR that “ It is seen from the above that share price of IPCL has more or less moved in sync with the sensex movement as observed in their respective declines on March 5 2007 subsequent to the announcement of the dividend by the company.\nIn fact on March 5 2007 scrip declines by 8.13% on BSE when the SENSEX declined by 3.79%.\nBut in a divergence from the index the scrip witnessed substantial price gain on March 8 2007 and March 9 2007 subsequent to the important announcement of amalgamation of IPCL with RIL.”\nIt is noted from the IR that the price of IPCL shares declined subsequent to the announcement in connection with the interim dividend and that the same has more or less moved in sync with the SENSEX movement.\nHowever the IR has attributed to the rise in the price of IPCL shares on 08.03.2007 and 09.03.2007 to the announcement of amalgamation of IPCL with RIL.\nNoticee on the other hand has No disputed that the aforesaid two announcements were PSI.\nIn view of the same and on the basis of explanation to Regulation 2 ha of PIT Regulations it is concluded that the aforesaid two announcements in connection with ‘declaration of interim dividend’ and ‘amalgamation of IPCL with RIL’ were ‘deemed PSI’ hereinafter referred to as ‘1st PSI’ and ‘2nd PSI’ respectively”.\nISSUE B When were the aforesaid two announcements made public by IPCL?\nAccording to the IR and as per the submissions of the Noticee vide its letter dated 08.02.2016 the announcement regarding declaration of interim dividend was made public by IPCL on 02.03.2007 at 1428 hrs.\nWhen OD was Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd asked to provide the supporting documents in connection with this announcement mentioned in the IR it provided a copy of the announcement archives for the period October 12 2006 – March 07 2007 from the BSE website referred by it as Flag A and first 4 pages of analysis report of stock exchanges referred at para 1 of this order along with a copy of an email dated 19.02.2013 from BSE referred by it as Flag B clarifying that the first announcement made by IPCL was received at BSE at 1352 hrs on 02.03.2007 and was disseminated on BSE website at 1401 hrs.\nFurther the announcement time 14.28 hrs stated in analysis report was the dissemination time at NSE as the report was combined by NSE.\nI note from the records that during the hearing before previous AO the Noticee has submitted that the time of announcement at BSE is 1401 hrs.\nFurther as per the copy of announcement dated 02.03.2007 submitted by the Noticee as Annexure I to its reply dated 08.02.2016 the time of this announcement at BSE is 1401 hrs.\nIn view of the above it can be concluded that the 1st PSI w.r.t. declaration of interim dividend was made public by IPCL on 02.03.2007 at 1401 hrs.\nIt is noted from the material made available on record that the 2nd PSI w.r.t. amalgamation of IPCL with RIL was made public on 07.03.2007 at 1715 hrs.\nISSUE C If the aforesaid two announcements were PSI when did they come into existence?\n1st PSI 32.\nThe Noticee’s submissions w.r.t. existence of the 1st PSI vide its replies dated 05.11.2012 08.02.2016 and at the time of hearings before the previous AO and the undersigned have been considered.\nIn short it is Noticee’s submission that the first announcement was made on 02.03.2007 within a couple of hours after the discussion between Shri S K Ananad and Shri Sethuraman on the said date.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd 33.\nOn a perusal of IR it is observed that the IR is silent on the issue as to when the 1st PSI came into existence.\nWhen a clarification was sought from the OD regarding the same it replied as follows “With respect to observations at paras 12.4 and 12.5 of the IR EFD has no comments to offer.\nThe material available on record for this purpose have been already provided please refer to para 3 xiii of the ON dated February 01 2016..”\nThe ON summed up that “It is submitted that on further examination by EFD apart from the information already provided in ON dated February 01 2016 no additional information could be gathered.\nI No proceed to record my findings on the issue based on material available on record.\nThe Noticee has submitted that since the Union Budget on 28.02.2007 contained a proposal to enhance the dividend distribution tax Shri S.K. Anand Wholetime Director of IPCL on 02.03.2007 advised Ms. Shashikala Rao Company Secretary of IPCL and Shri K Sethuraman Vice President Corporate Secretarial of RIL who also oversaw secretarial activities of the subsidiaries and associate companies of RIL to call a board meeting of IPCL to consider declaration of interim dividend.\nWhile no records of these communications have been submitted by the Noticee it has submitted affidavits of Shri K Sethuraman Shri S.K. Anand and Shri Mukesh Ambani in support of its submissions.\nAs regards Noticee’s contention about “announcement was made on 02.03.2007 within a couple of hours after the discussion between…” I note that at the time of the hearing on 01.02.2016 the representatives had submitted a ‘list of dates and events’ & verbally mentioned the timings of the various events mentioned therein.\nSince the representatives verbally mentioned the timings of various events they were asked to put the timings of various events on record.\nAlthough the representatives undertook to submit the aforesaid information they have No furnished specific time of the discussion.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd 37.\nWith respect to the Noticee’s submission that it has ascertained that IPCL closed its trading window on 02.03.2007 when the 1st PSI came into existence it is noted that supporting documents have No been submitted by the Noticee to substantiate its claim.\nThus in absence of any material in IR and in the absence of any other direct or circumstantial evidence to indicate the existence of 1st PSI before 02.03.2007 I have no material based on which I can differ from the Noticee’s contention that the 1st PSI came into existence on 02.03.2007. 2nd PSI 39.\nOn a perusal of IR it is observed that the IR is silent on the issue as to when the 2nd PSI came into existence.\nAs per the IR the ‘information with regard to above mentioned announcement was available with the company much before the same was communicated to the stock exchanges” based on the following observations • As per the information collected from various intermediaries which were involved in the process of deciding the merger ratio between RIL and IPCL the process started on March 5 2007.\n• The company did No make any announcement to stock exchange on March 5 2007.\nThis indicates that the decision to appoint the intermediaries was apparently taken before the 5th of March.\n• It is also felt that the valuation process for arriving at a merger ratio between these two companies would require analysis of substantial information and taking into account that the valuers arrived at the merger ratio within the period 5th March to 10th March therefore on the basis of facts and circumstances available currently and subject to entity’s replies there seems no reason to assume that the process of assembling of data for providing the same to the valuers must have No started well before the date of 5th March 2007.\nTo a query seeking documentary evidence with regard to the aforesaid assumption OD vide its ON dated 01.02.2016 informed that “The abovementioned statement appears to be a conclusion drawn by the Investigating Officer based on the material on record and EFD has no comments to offer in the matter”.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd 41.\nThe IR has observed that process of deciding the merger ratio between RIL and IPCL started on 05.03.2007. Further the IR has observed that the decision to appoint the intermediaries was apparently taken before 05.03.2007. IR has No provided any material or a specific date ‘before 05.03.2007’ for this inference.\nIR has stated that the information was available with the company much before the same was communicated to the stock exchanges.\nBut it has No stated how much before the information was available with the company.\nOn a perusal of the letter of engagement of various intermediaries involved in the merger process it is noted that all the letters are dated on or after 05.03.2007. IR has observed that based on facts and circumstances and subject to entity’s replies process of data collection must have started before 05.03.2007.\nIt has No been mentioned in the IR as to which entity’s reply it is referring to.\nFurther no direct or circumstantial evidence has been put forth in IR to show that the data collection started before 05.03.2007 or the date on which the data was provided to the valuers.\nThus the observation made in the IR that the 2nd PSI came into existence ‘much before 05.03.2007’ is No supported by any documents relied upon by the IR for such inference No any specific date ‘before 05.03.2007’ is mentioned .\nThe Noticee on the other hand has submitted that on 04.03.2007 there was a meeting among Shri Mukesh Ambani Shri Alok Agarwal RIL Chief Financial Officer and Shri L.V Merchant RIL Controller Accounts for a possible merger between RIL and IPCL.\nHowever except for the affidavits of the aforesaid persons the Noticee has No submitted any Minutes of the said meeting or any other records of the meeting to substantiate its claim.\nIn this regard Hon’ble SAT in the matter of Dilip S. Pendse Vs.\nSEBI Appeal No 80 of 2009 has observed as follows “… the charge of insider trading is one of the most serious charges in relation to the securities market and having regard to the gravity of this wrong doing higher must be the preponderance of probabilities in establishing the same…” Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd 44.\nIn view of the above and in absence of any indication in IR as to when the 2nd PSI came into existence and in absence of any evidence direct or circumstantial by the Investigating Authority to establish the existence of PSI before 05.03.2007 I have no material based on which I can differ from the Noticee’s contention that the 2nd PSI came into existence on 04.03.2007. ISSUE D Whether the Noticee and RIL are ‘insider’ as per Regulation 2e of PIT Regulations?\nThe provision of Regulation 2 e of PIT Regulations is as under e insider” means any person who is or was connected with the company or is deemed to have been connected with the company and who is reasonably expected to have access to unpublished price sensitive information in respect of securities of a company or who has received or has had access to such unpublished price sensitive information.\nThe provision of Regulation 2 h of PIT Regulations is as under “person is deemed to be a connected person” if such person— i is a company under the same management or group or any subsidiary company thereof within the meaning of subsection 1B of section 370 or subsection 11 of section 372 of the Companies Act 1956 1 of 1956 or subclause g of section 2 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1969 54 of 1969 as the case may be; or 47.\nThe allegation in the SCN that Noticee and RIL are deemed to be connected persons in terms of Regulation 2h of PIT Regulations have been detailed at para 6f of this order.\nFurther the allegation in the SCN that Noticee was in possession of UPSI has been detailed at para 6g of this order.\nAlso the allegation in the SCN that the Noticee and RIL are considered as ‘insider’ has been detailed at para 6f of this order.\nThe submissions of the Noticee with respect to the same have also been detailed at prepages in this order.\nIt is alleged in the SCN that Shri Mukesh Ambani is the Chairman of IPCL and Chairman and Managing Director of RIL therefore in terms of clause i of Subsection 1B of section 370 of Companies Act 1956 IPCL and RIL are Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd deemed to be under the same management.\nThe requirement under the applicable provision i.e  Section 370 1B i a of Companies Act 1956 is that the managing agent secretaries and treasurers managing director or manager of the one body corporate should be the same as that of the other body corporate.\nI note from the Annual Report of RIL for the year 20052006 as made available by the OD that Shri Mukesh Ambani was the Chairman of IPCL and was also the Chairman and Managing Director of RIL.\nSince the provision of Section 370 1B i a of Companies Act 1956 has No been fulfilled IPCL and RIL cannot be deemed to be under the same management in terms of the provisions of Section 370 1B i a of Companies Act 1956.\nSCN has alleged that IPCL and RIL are deemed to be under the same management in terms of clause iii of Subsection 1B of Section 370 of Companies Act 1956 as RPIL holds more than onethird of the total voting power of IPCL.\nFurther the SCN has also alleged that since RIL holds the entire share capital of RPIL through two of its wholly own subsidiaries therefore in terms of clause iii of Subsection 1B of Section 370 of Companies Act 1956 RPIL and RIL are deemed to be under the same management.\nSection 3701B iii of the Companies Act 1956 reads as under 1B For the purposes of sub sections 1 and 1A] two bodies corporate shall be deemed to be under the same management … iii if No less than one third of the total voting power with respect to any matter relating to each of the two bodies corporate is exercised or controlled by the same individual or body corporate; or 51.\nOn a perusal of the aforesaid section it is noted that the section envisages a triangular structure where one individual or body corporate has to exercise onethird or more total voting power over each of the two body corporates to be considered as companies under same management.\nAs per material available on record including IR there is no single entity or individual who is common to IPCL and RIL which exercises onethird or more Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd voting power over both the entities IPCL and RIL.\nThus the requirement under Section 3701B iii of the Companies Act 1956 of a triangular structure is No fulfilled.\nSince the requirement of Section 3701B iii of the Companies Act 1956 is No fulfilled in the given facts and circumstances IPCL and RIL cannot be deemed to be under the same management in terms of Section 3701B iii of the Companies Act 1956.\nSimilarly there is no single entity or individual who is common to RPIL and RIL who holds onethird or more voting power over both the entities.\nSince the requirement of Section 3701B iii of the Companies Act 1956 is No fulfilled in the given facts and circumstances RPIL and RIL cannot be deemed to be under the same management in terms of Section 3701B iii of the Companies Act 1956.\nAs regards to the Noticee’s submission that RPIL and IPCL are No deemed to be under the same management of RIL in terms of Section 370 1B iii of Companies Act 1956 I note from the IR that RIL holds the entire share capital of RPIL through two of its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nAs per the information submitted by RPIL RVL holds 50% of the paidup capital of RPIL RPPL holds 25% of the RPIL and RNPL holds the balance 25% of RPIL.\nRVL is wholly owned subsidiary of RIL.\nRSIL which is also a whollyowned subsidiary of RIL holds 40% of the paidup capital of RPPL and 30% of the paidup capital of RNPL with the balance holding in each of these two companies cross held by them.\nIn effect it is observed that RSIL holds 50% shares of RPIL when shorn 33.33 % or more Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd of the intricacy of cross holdings.\nTherefore RIL holds 100% share capital of RPIL since it is the holding company of both RSIL and RVL.\nIt is noted from material available on record that the Noticee held 46% of share capital in IPCL as on 31.03.2006.\nAs per the disclosures made by IPCL under Regulation 8 3 of SAST Regulations as on 31.03.2006 RPIL is named as a “promoter having control over the company”.\nFurther RIL has been shown as a “persons acting in concert” with RPIL.\nAs stated above RIL holds 100% share capital of RPIL through its various subsidiaries.\nThe Noticee has submitted that RIL as a single entity did No directly hold the requisite onethird shares in RPIL as the shareholding of RPIL was crossheld by a number of subsidiaries.\nOn a perusal of Section 370 1B iii of Companies Act 1956 it is noted that the provision states that No less than onethird of the total voting power with respect to any matter relating to each of the two bodies corporate has to be exercised or controlled by the same individual or body corporate.\nThe provisions do No mention that those voting rights have to be necessarily exercised directly.\nFurther the Noticee has submitted that the expression “the same individual or body corporate” occurring in Section 370 1B iii of Companies Act 1956 implies singular number only and No plural as per Ministry of Corporate Affairs Department Circular No 15 31CLVI 62 dated 20.07.1962.\nIn the instant matter more than onethird voting power in RPIL is exercised by RIL through a number of subsidiaries.\nIn view of the aforesaid findings at paras 5556 I note that RIL excercises more than onethird voting power in both the companies RPIL and IPCL.\nTherefore I do No find any merit in the submission of the Noticee that RPIL and IPCL are No deemed to be under the same management of RIL in terms of Section 370 1B iii of Companies Act 1956.\nHence RIL RPIL and IPCL are deemed to be connected.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd Was the Noticee in possession of the UPSI?\nAccording to IR based on the following factors it can be reasonably said that the Noticee had access to UPSI • By virtue of control over IPCL.\n• Shri K Sethuraman represented on behalf of RPIL and the orders for buying the shares of IPCL were placed by one Shri Ashok C Jain who is an employee of RIL.\nTherefore it is clear that RIL was having the entire control over RPIL and the employees of RIL were making investment decisions on behalf of RPIL.\nIt is also pertinent to mention that Shri K Sethuraman was the contact person on behalf of RIL for interacting with the legal advisor valuers financial advisors etc. in the matter of merger of RIL with IPCL.\nTherefore by virtue of close proximity of RPIL and RIL employees as explained above it is believed that RPIL had access to UPSI.\n• The purchase of shares of IPCL by RPIL was financed by RVL through an interest free loan.\nRVL is a wholly owned subsidiary of RIL.\n• It is observed that during the period June 9 2006 to February 26 2007 the Noticee had No dealt in the shares of IPCL but all of sudden started buying the shares of IPCL from February 27 2007 i.e  just before the major announcement of declaration of the interim dividend and amalgamation of IPCL with RIL.\nThe IR does No bring out the names of the persons of the Noticee who was believed to be reasonably expected to have access to UPSI and the names of the persons from whom the Noticee was believed to be reasonably expected to have access to UPSI or any documentary evidence in this regard.\nFurther I note that although IR has ‘believed’ that RPIL was having access to UPSI prior to its investments and observed that Shri Ashok C Jain was placing the orders for IPCL shares on behalf of RPIL it is silent whether he was having any access to UPSI and if so how.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd 62.\nWhen documentary evidence w.r.t. access of UPSI by Noticee alongwith the name of the persons was sought from the OD it replied as follows;\n“…The observation at para 12.6 appears to be a conclusion drawn by the Investigating Officer based on observations at paras 12.4 and 12.5. EFD has no comments to offer on the same.\nThe material available on record for this purpose are inter alia the following a.\nCorrespondence between SEBI and intermediaries which were involved in the process of deciding the merger ratio between RIL and IPCL enclosed at Flag E b.\nStatement of K. Sethuraman enclosed at Flag G c.\nCorrespondence between RPIL and SEBI  Flag D and F.” 63.\nIt is noted from disclosures under Regulation 8 3 of SEBI Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations 1997 as on March 31 2006 Noticee is named as a “promoter having control over the company” with the total shareholding of 46% of IPCL.\nThe Noticee on the other hand has given the names of officials who discussed on 02.03.2007 about calling the Board meeting to consider declaration of interim dividend.\nIt is observed that Shri K Sethuraman who was the Vice President Corporate Secretarial for RIL and in performance of his duties in RIL also oversaw the secretarial activities of the subsidiaries and associate companies of RIL which includes the Noticee was involved in the said process.\nIR has further observed that Shri Ashok C Jain who is an employee of RIL was placing the orders to buy shares of IPCL which the Noticee has No disputed.\nThe Noticee has submitted that Shri Ashok C Jain is No reasonably expected to access to PSIs which are taken at the highest management level.\nI note that Noticee has stated that Shri Ashok Jain was the “Principal Officer” of RPIL under RBI’s NBFC Regulations and enclosed an extract of board minutes of RPIL dated 25.04.2006 in this regard.\nFurther the Noticee has stated that Shri Ashok Jain was authorized by the Board of RPIL to make investments upto Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd the limits allowed under the Board resolutions from time to time which was a commercial decision.\nTo substantiate its claim the Noticee has submitted documentary evidence in the form of minutes of Board Meeting held on 25.04.2006 and 04.01.2007. 66.\nI note from the minutes of the aforesaid Board meeting held on 04.01.2007 i.e  more than a month earlier to the date when the 1st PSI came into existence that Directors of RPIL and Shri Ashok C Jain were authorized by the Board of RPIL to invest on its behalf in the shares of IPCL upto a limit of 100 crore.\nIR has also observed that the Noticee has No dealt in the shares of IPCL during the period June 09 2006 to February 26 2007 but all of a sudden started buying the shares of IPCL from February 27 2007 i.e  just before both the announcements.\nThe Noticee has submitted that pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement and open offer it held 46% shares in IPCL.\nIt has regularly done creeping acquisitions in the shares of IPCL post 2002.\nIt has purchased about 12 lakh shares of IPCL during the period MayJune 2006.\nThereafter the share prices started increasing and even touched 325 per share.\nIt was only in the third week of February 2007 the price witnessed a fall to around 250 and it was decided to purchase further quantity.\nI note that Noticee has purchased shares of IPCL during 2006.\nFurther vide Board Meeting held on 04.01.2007 Noticee was further authorised by its Board to invest in the shares of IPCL.\nSuch authorization was given earlier also as can be seen from the minutes of the Board Meeting of RPIL held on 25.04.2006. I note from the data furnished by the Noticee that the price of IPCL shares has broadly moved in the direction claimed by the Noticee.\nIR has observed that the purchase of shares of IPCL by RPIL was financed by RVL through an interest free loan.\nRVL is a wholly owned subsidiary of RIL.\nThe said fact has No been disputed by the Noticee.\nThe Noticee has submitted that RIL acquired IPCL and RPIL was the entity through which the acquisition was undertaken.\nIt is only natural that RIL or its wholly owned subsidiary will Adjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd fund RPIL for its business needs including monies required for creeping acquisition of IPCL shares.\nIn support of its claim the Noticee vide its letter dated 19.11.2012 has furnished a copy of ledger account of RVL in the books of RPIL for the period 01.04.2006 to 31.03.2007 showing the details of all unsecured loans taken and returned back and the balance outstanding as on 31.03.2007.\nOn perusal of the said record I note that during the period 01.04.2006 to 31.03.2007 the Noticee has received a sum of 732.17 crore as unsecured loans in 22 tranches from RVL and has paid back a sum of 62.80 crore to RVL.\nIn view of the above and in absence of any evidence by the Investigating Authority to establish the access of UPSI to the Noticee it can be concluded that the Noticee did No have access to UPSI while trading in the scrip of IPCL.\nHence it can be concluded that the Noticee and RIL are No ‘insider’ as alleged in the SCN in terms of provisions of Regulation 2e of PIT Regulations.\nISSUE E If the answer to the aforesaid question is in affirmative whether the Noticee has violated provisions of Regulation 3 of PIT Regulations?\nIn view of the finding at para 70 it can be concluded that the Noticee has No violated provisions of Regulation 3 of PIT Regulations.\nISSUE F If the answer to the aforesaid question is in affirmative whether the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under Section 15G of the SEBI Act?\nIn view of the finding at para 71 the Noticee is No liable for monetary penalty under Section 15G of the SEBI Act.\nISSUE G What quantum of monetary penalty should be imposed on the Noticee if the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under Section 15G of the SEBI Act?\nSince the Noticee is No liable for monetary penalty in the instant matter this issue deserves no consideration.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd ORDER 74. .\nIn view of my findings noted in the preceding paragraphs I hereby dispose of the Adjudication Proceedings initiated against Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd vide SCN dated 31.01.2011. 75.\nIn terms of the provisions of Rule 6 of the SEBI Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer Rules 1995 a copy each of this Order is being sent to Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd and also to Securities and Exchange Board of India.\nDate 08.03.2016 Suresh Gupta Place Mumbai Adjudicating Officer", "On conclusion of investigation Shri Parag Basu was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer hereinafter referred to as AO vide order dated 23.04.2010 to inquire and adjudge under Section 15G of the SEBI Act the alleged violations of the provisions of Regulation 3 of SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 hereinafter referred to as PIT Regulations by Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd hereinafter referred to as ‘RPIL Noticee’ as observed pursuant to the investigation."))

Gupta  Mr Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria  Mr Prakash Chandra Purohit and  Mr Bhagwat Singh Kitawat received before the hearing and received in the hearing on behalf of Ms. Neha B Raval.\nKey submissions of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta in the reply dated April 16 2018 “I deny the allegations against me made in the SCN.\nI have made request to allow me inspection of all the related documents including Investigation Report and Original Trade and Order Log in the above said matter.\nHowever the said request was rejected by your goodself.\nI once again request your goodself to allow me inspection of the documents.\nI am compelled to file my submissions on the present available documents and data.\nPrice Volume data and Trade Log data provided with the SCN are having contradictions.\nOn perusal of the Price Volume Data provided with the SCN Annexure D it is revealed that there were total 254 trades executed during the Patch 1 i.e  17092013 to 1908 2014.\nHowever as per the Trade Log it i s revealed that only 167 trades were executed during the aforesaid period.\nThus the data provided with the SCN are contradicting each other and I am in dilemma as which data I should rely.\nIt is alleged in the SCN that I had sold 44 shares of the Svaraj Trad ing & Agencies Ltd on market and executed total 24 trades and thus influence the price of the scrip by Rs 31.15 +ve from Last Traded Price LTP.\nIt is further alleged that I had received 50 shares of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd through off market transfer from Laxman Diwan and 47 shares from Mukesh Mohanlal Agarwal who both are admittedly No parties to the SCN.\nIt is further alleged that I had transferred shares of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd through off market to  Mr Anil Vishnu Bharti 25 Shares and Rajesh Jayanti lal Savad ia 15 shares.\nThe alleged connection is the only reason for inclusion of my name in the SCN as a Noticee otherwise two entities namely Bheru Singh Kitawat and Bheru Lal Gujer who had executed sell trades for 56 shares and 10 shares in the Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd and increased the price by Rs 12.05 and Rs 5.25 respectively were No made parties to the SCN.\nIt is humbly submitted that admittedly I had no on market transactions with the Noticee mentioned in the SCN.\nIt is No an allegation against me that I had executed any circular synchronized reversal selftrades and or manipulated the price of the scrip by executing trades with the alleged Noticees mentioned in the SCN.\nThus the allegation of connection with the entities mentioned at serial number 3 and 4 of the SCN are no significance with the execution of on market transactions by me.\nI further say and submit that I had executed only sell transactions du ring the Patch 1 i.e  17092013 to 1908201 4 of the Investigation Period.\nI have admittedly no connection relation wi th the counterparties to my trades.\nTherefore the allegation of violation of PFUTP Regu lation should No have been levied against me.\nIn this regard I rely two judgements passed by the Honble Securities Appellate Tribunal viz Vikas Ganesh Mal Bengani v s Whole Time Member SEBI Appeal No 225 of 2009 Order dated 25022010.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd A similar issue arose be.fore this Tribunal in Jagruti Securities Limited vs Securities and Exchange Board of India Appeal No 102 of 2006 decided on October 27 2008 and it was held that for the charge of raising price artificially to be established the element of collusion between the buye r and the seller is a sine qua non.\nWhile referring to the screen based trading system where buyers and sellers put in their orders through their respective brokers and the trades get executed only when the buy and sell orders match subject to price time priority this is what the Tribunal observed “……………It is thus clear that in order to establish the charge of price manipulation collusion between the buyer and the seller is necessary.\nIn the case before us it has No been alleged that the appellant was colluding with the counterparty seller or with his broker.\nIn the absence of such an allegation it cannot be held that the appellant was manipulating the price of the scrip of the company upwards.”\nSince no allegation of collusion is being made in the entire SCN in between me and counterparties to my trades the allegation charge of PFUTP are futile.\nSince no allegation have been alleged against the counterparties to my trades buyers the allegation made against me in the above referred SCN also untenable.\nIn this regard order of hon’ble SAT in the ma tter of A d o l f P i n t o V s SEBI A ppeal No 102 of 2010 was quoted.\nIt is further submitted that off market t r a n s a c t i o n per se No illegal and it is held legal by the Hon ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in catena of cases.\nIt is further submitted that I had sol d shares of Svaraj Trading and Agencies Limited in m arketable lot legal ly allowed by the Bom bay Stock Exchange Mumbai.\nTherefore I han No violated any provision of PFUTP Regulations.\nI further say and submit that either the Stock Excha nge or my Broker had No issued any warni ng to me for executing t rades in lot of one shares.\nI had traded withi n the prescribed ci rcuit filter set by the Exchange.\nI had fulfilled all obligations towa rds pay in of delivery.\nI further submi ts that I have no role in the increase in the price of the scrip.\nIt is the sign i ficant demand in the shares of the Compa ny who compel the scrips price to go up.\nIt is further submitted that besides my hol ding in the shares of Svaraj Trading and Agencies Lim ited hundreds of other entities hold the shares of the Compa ny.\nI had admi ttedly no control over the others holding and they were free to sell their shares to the buyer.\nI t i s their choice that did No sel l t hei r shar e s during the Patch I.\nHow the Noticees to the SCN including me became responsible for No selling shares by the other shareholders of the company in reference?\nIt is further submitted that everyday thousands of entities place orders and execute trades in the lot of one shares.\nAre they too responsible for the alleged violation of PFUTP Regulations?\nCertainly not and if they are No responsible then how I became responsible for trades executed in the lot of one share.\nIt is very perti nent to mention that the pri ce of the scrip is accepted by the market participants and current ly price of the scrip is quoti ng around Rs 200 .\nWithout my intervention the price of the scrip is sustained above Rs 150 .\nThus the price of the scrip increased due to actual demand in the scrip of the Company and No by artificially demand.\nI f the price of the scrip was i n c r e a s e d arti ficially as alleged i n the SCN it would have certainly fell down ti ll now.\nI therefore pray to your goodsel f to consider my aforesaid submissions and dispose of the SCN without passing any adverse order against me.\nKey submissions of Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria in the reply dated April 19 2018  Subsequent to the receipt of the SCN vide letter dated 20032018 our Client sought copies of the Investigation Report with all the annexures complete trade and order log relied upon by SEBI while issuing the Notice in Our Clients name in order to facilitate our Client to file a detailed reply to the Notice.\nHowever vide communication 06042018 SEBI refused to provide with the aforesaid documents and asked Our Client to file a reply before your goodself by 19 April 2018.\nOur Client was given the opportunity of personal hearing on 20 April 2018.\nHowever by communication dated 19042018 the date of hearing adjourned to 0905 2018.\nSince Our Client has No been served with the Investigation Report and other relevant documents thus the present reply cannot be treated as the final reply.\nAt the outset it is submitted that Our Client does No admit or accept any statement or allegations contained in the Notice except to the extent that the same is expressly agreed.\nNothing stated in the Notice shall be deemed to be admitted by Our Client merely on account of non traverse unless the same is specifically admitted.\nA perusal of the Notice reveals that the allegation made against Our Client is as follows aDuring patch 1 of Investigation period viz.\n17 September 2013 to 19 August 2014 hereinafter referred to as the relevant period Our Client amongst other contributing entities is responsible for increasing the price of the scrip at BSE from Rs 7.14 to Rs 146.50 with a daily average of 2 shares being traded. b Our Client is one of the entities who have indulged in trades resulting to significant positive LTP thereby resulting to price rise.\nIt is submitted that Our Client is among the 8 entities to whom the Notice has been issued.\nHowever we shall be dealing with violations as alleged only against Our Client.\nAt the outset the above stated allegations are without any basis and hence devoid of merit and for the facts and circumstances stated herein the Notice ought to be dropped immediately against Our Client.\nIt is submitted that Our Client is No in violation of any provisions of law much less the provisions of SEBI Act.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd The above allegations against Our Client have been sought to be substantiated on the basis of the following a.\nOur Client has received 25 shares of STAL from  Mr Laxman Diwan in offmarket b.\nOur client is allegedly connected with  Mr Laxman diwan who is a Director of one Miraj Products Pvt Ltd Considering the allegations and the basis of the said allegations against Our Client in the Notice the same broadly fall under the two following issues Connection of Our Client with  MrLaxman Diwan It is submitted that the connection stated in the Notice is entirely without any basis.\nThere is absolutely no documentary evidence that Our Client was a part of the connected entities.\nOur Client has nothing in common with the other entities.\nThe Notice without any established finding and only on the premise that the scrip of STAL was received from one  Mr Laxman Diwan is alleging that our Client is a connected entity.\nNowhere the Notice shows a nexus between our Client and Miraj Productions Pvt Ltd Therefore the Notice and the Annexures therein bears no footing and provides no conclusive explanation while alleging that Our Client was a connected entity.\nMoreover the fact that SEBI has No made  Mr Laxman Diwan a party to the Notice despite him being the transferor of shares and equally responsible for the transaction with respect to the scrip of STAL with Our Client further substantiates our Clients case that this transaction does No establish any connivance.\nTherefore the issuance of the Notice itself is arbitrary and selective.\nTherefore the Notice is based on surmises and conjectures as the alleged connivance bears no substratum and is only to establish a link with another illfounded allegation of manipulation of market by price increase which is entirely unwarranted and unjustified.\nIn the case of Smitaben N. Shah v.\nSEBI Date of decision 30 July 2010 it was held by Honble SAT that We cannot lose sight of the fact that a serious charge like fraudulent trading cannot be established on the basis of this tenuous and farfetched connection.\nIn this view of the matter we have no hesitation to hold that the appellants did No act in tandem with any of the entities referred to in Annexure 2 as alleged in the show cause notice and found by the whole time member.\nEmphasis added It is therefore submitted that allegations such serious in nature and bearing serious charge of fraudulent trade practice cannot be made and a Notice be issued in furtherance of such bald allegations merely on the basis of farfetched untenable assumptions and without any documentary evidence.\nOur Clients role in increase of price of scrip At the outset it is pertinent to state that the Notice is comprises of inaccurate information and data about Our Client.\nAs mentioned in paragraph 7 of the Notice a trade log at Annexure D is attached to the Notice which shows how the price of scrip rose during the relevant period.\nFrom the said Annexure D it can be noticed that in details of our Clients share price & volume movement at various dates when the number of shares were 1 the number of trades against it were 2.\nThis shows that the investigation itself is full of defects and on that ground itself this Notice ought to be withdrawn against Our Client.\nWithout prejudice to the above stated contention it is submitted that our Client is amongst the various other shareholders of STAL and like any other shareholder has the right to trade in order to achieve the best price for the scrip.\nTherefore all the trades executed by Our Client were in the normal course of trading and does No form a part of fraudulent or manipulative practice as alleged in the Notice.\nThe primary allegation against Our Client is that he has sold shares in miniscule quantities such as 1 share in 34 trades and 18 trades in 1 trade as opposed to the buy orders of larger quantities.\nIt is submitted that when the lot size of STAL scrip was of only 1 share it is upon the seller buyer to place the order of the quantity as per their desire and No on the counter partys order quantities.\nTherefore the contention that Our Client sold the shares at miniscule value even when the buy order was in higher quantities is completely misconceived as the charge of manipulation cannot be based on the order quantity of an entity but on the trades and trading pattern of such entity.\nIt is a well settled principle that every trade establishes the price of the scrip.\nThis principle is established in Smitaben N. Shah vs  Securities and Exchange Board of India wherein it was held that It is by No well settled that every trade establishes the price of the scrip.\nWe cannot lose sight of the fact that the impugned purchase orders of the appellants had been executed on the first day of trading when there was no circuit filter on the price range of the scrip and the price discovery mechanism of the stock exchanges was in full play to discover the price…………………….\nThe fact that only insignificant quantity of orders of the appellants got executed as trades at the rate of Rs 30 per share goes to show that their initial exercise of testing the waters proved successful only to a very limited extent and they had to raise the bar to get the desired quantity of shares.\nThis pattern of trading is No unusual to cause any alarm.\nThis above holding further establishes Our Clients case that the trading done by Our Client was absolutely a normal course of practice.\nAssuming whilst denying the allegation that Our Client sold shares in miniscule quantities there were also instance where our Client has sold 8 shares in 1 trade that too in zero LTP.\nThis instance establishes the fact that Our Client was at no point interested in miniscule trading to which would anyway lead to no gains for him.\nIt is also submitted that the sale of shares in miniscule quantity over the period of days is a natural practice in order to seek a better value of the share and thus Our Client cannot be charged under any provision of law much less the PFUTP for any manner of fraudulent or unfair trade practice.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd As and when Our Client would observe that the price of the share is raising it was desirable by Our Client to avail a higher price for the share.\nIt is further submitted that Our Client has No made any abundant profits by trading the scrip of STAL No does the Notice reflect that Our Client has benefitted in any manner from such alleged manipulation.\nMoreover Our Client being a regular share trader and would No indulge in such a practice and put his trading reputation at stake.\nIt is therefore expressly denied that Our Client has at any point of time engaged in a trade that would lead to market manipulation or any kind of unfair trade practice.\nIt is also denied that Our Client indulged in miniscule trading in order to manipulate the price of the scrip.\nIn view of the submissions made above no violation of any provisions of SEBI PFUTP Regulations 2003 can be made out against Our Client therefore holding an inquiry in terms of Rule 4 of SEBI Adjudication Rules 1995 read with Section 15 I of the SEBI Act; and imposing in tenns of Rule 5 of the said Rules and the provisions of Section 15 HA of SEBI Act does No follow and it is prayed that the Notice proceedings be dropped against me.\nIt is therefore requested to your goodself to grant an opportunity of personal hearing before passing of any Orders in the matter and we on behalf of Our Client crave leave to file Additional Submissions if so required.”\nKey submissions of Prakash Chandra Purohit in the reply dated April 16 2018  “I am in receipt of the captioned Show Cause Notice hereinafter referred to as SCN dated 15 02 2018.\nIn furtherance to which my authorized representative vide email dated 2 03 2018 had sought inspection of the documents relied upon by SEBI while issuing the captioned · SCN including the Investigation Report with all the annexures and also the complete Order Log so as to enable me to file a detailed reply to the captioned SCN.\nFurther SEBI vide email dated 06 04 2018 rejected the said request and granted time till 19 04 2018 to file c. rep y before ym.r. r goodself and a second and final opportunity of personal hearing on 20 04 2018.\nTherefore based on the limited data documents available with me I am filing this present reply.\nIn the SCN it has been alleged that I along with other entities alleged connected group indulged in trades in minuscule quantities repeatedly at price higher than LTP during 17 09 2014 to 17 11 2014 {hereinafter referred to as Investigation Period Relevan t Period resulting to manipulation of the price of the scrip of STAL thereby violating Regulation 3a b c d 41 4{2 a} and e} of SEBI PFUTP Regulations 2003.\nIn the said SCN I have been called upon to show cause as to why an inquiry be No held against me in terms of Rule 4 of the SEBI Adjudicating Rules 1995 read with Section 15 I of the SEBI Act; and penalty be No imposed in terms of Rule 5 of the said Rules and the provisions of Section 15 HA of SEBI Act.\nAt the outset I deny each and every statement allegation observation etc. made in the captioned SCN and nothing stated in the captioned SCN shall be deemed to be admitted by virtue of No having been specifically denied or dealt with unless the same has been expressly dealt with.\nIn the said SCN I have been alleged to be merely connected to other entities who had traded in the scrip of STAL also the noticees in the present SCN.\nIt is submitted that the basis of connections are very baseless unsubstantiated and cannot be relied upon just because I had a common address with one  Mr Bhagwat Singh Kitawat and was a Director of Miraj Products Pvt Ltd along with one Mr Laxman Diwan who had sold his shares in STAL.\nThe mere ground of common address and being a Director of a Company whose another Director had sold his shares in STAL does No mean that I am connected to all the other entities mentioned above and have in any manner manipulated the price of STAL or acted unfairly to increase the price of STAL alongwith other entities to this SCN.\nIt is submitted that the burden of proof is on SEBI to prove as to whether I was connected to all the entities mentioned ·above and also whether there was any prior meeting of minds or collusion with such entities to manipulate the price of the scrip of STAL.\nHowever no such exercise has been done by SEBI while issuing the present SCN.\nIt is submitted that the present proceedings against me are farce and fail to prove any connection whatsoever to manipulate the price of shares of STAL and therefore the present proceedings shall be dropped based on this point only as I do No have any connection whatsoever with other entities as alleged in the SCN and therefore in furtherance the charge of any violation of PFUTP Regulation does No stand.\nIn the SCN it has been alleged that out of the other 7 entities to the SCN 5 entities are connected with 49 preferential allottees who had received shares in the preferential allotment dated 25 07 2013.\nThe basis on which the connection has been alleged is only that I and Laxman Diwan were directors in Miraj Products Pvt Ltd and the said Laxman Diwan has transferred his shares to Noticees of the said SCN.\nIt is pertinent to note that the said Laxman Diwan has No been investigated by the SEBI which shows that there is no connection found of the said Laxman Diwan .\nIt is submitted that merely because I was a Director in Miraj Projects Pvt Ltd and the other Director sold Adjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd sha.ces ·in STAL it cannot be assumed that I am connected with other entities to the said SCN.· Moreover the SEBI has No issued any SCN to two entities of the top ten LTP contributing entities.\nThis basis of connection established by SEBI is absurd and cannot stand any ground.\nIt is submitted that the charge of manipulation should be established independently based on the trades and conduct or intention of each entity.\nIf at all it is established that I was connected to the said 5 preferential allottees it is submitted that there is no allegation whatsoever against thesaid preferential allottees to have violated any PFUTP Regulations No any show cause notice has been issued to the said 49 entities.\nIt is submitted that the inclusion of the Preferential Allotment in the said SCN fails to prove any sort of violation under the PFUTP Regulations and moreover it does No prove my connection with any of the entities in the said SCN.\nThe Honble Securities Appellate Tribunal in various Judgments has dealt with the situation where a noticee was alleged to be a part of an alleged group.\nExtracts of several relevant judgments are reproduced herein below Narendra Ganatra vs  SEBI Date of decision 29 07 201l Jt is the case of Appellan t that he had No indulged in any fraudulent or unfair trade practic e while dealing in the scrip of the company.\nAll his transactions were carried out through the stock exchange mechanism during trading hours and were executed at the then prevailing market price.\nAll these transactions were delivery based and there was real and effective transfer of ben.ef i c i a l ownership.\nAt the time of entering into these transactions the Appellant was No holding any position in the company.\nHe became Director of the company much later Dr. Poomima Ad vani Learned Counsel for the Board strenuously argued before us that the Appellant was known to the Managing Director of the company and he the Appellant facilitated the promoter group entities to offload their shares in favour of the Ganatra Group entities.\nThe fact that at a later d ate i.e  on August 1 2007 the appellant was appointed as Director of the company and later became Managing Director of the company is sufficient proof of his connivance with the promoter group and his being a part of the Gantara group in entering into circular trades.\nWe are unable to accept the arguments of Learned Counsel for the Board.\nEven the Adjudicating Officer while passing the impugned order has No been able to bring any evidence on record to indicate nexus of the Appellant with other group entities and has inferred the collusion from attending circumstances.\nThis is what he has said in para 17 of his ord er 17.\nThe abovenamed details prima faci e suggest about the connection relation between the Noticee and the other group members.\nThe said d etails also indicate relation connection of the Noticee with GIL and its promoters.\nHowever I am of the view that since in this regard no other evidence i s available to indicate direct nexus of the Noticee with the said other entities it would be appropriate to infer collusion from the attending circumstances of the case that have been discussed below.emphasis supplied ....We should No lose sight of the fact that the charge against the Appellan t is of conniving with the group entities in creating false and misleading appearances of trading in the market and artificially raising the price of the scrip and for such a serious charge higher degree of pro bability is required …………….” No dealing with the trades executed by me in the scrip of STAL it is submitted that all the trades executed by me were in normal course of business and no fraudulent or manipulative practice can be alleged against me for such trades.\nThere is no evidence or finding in the SCN that I was colluding with the other alleged group entities or there was a prior meeting of minds to manipulate the price of the scrip of STAL.\nThe SCN has been issued based on mere surmises and conjectures without any iota of evidence against me based on which I have been alleged to have violated the said PFUTP Regulation.\nA charge of market manipulation is a very serious violation which should be supported with higher degree of evidence.\nOnly based on farfetched connection the present SCN has been issued to me.\nIn the SCN it has been alleged that I have sold 63 shares in 10 trades in miniscule quantity ranging from 150 shares against existing buy orders for larger quantities.\nIn this regard it is submitted that the lot size of the scrip of STAL is 1 and therefore it is upon the buyer or seller to place the order quantity at their own wish and No depending on the counter partys order quantity.\nIn any event the charge of manipulation cannot be based on the order quantity of any entity it has to be based on the trades or the trading pattern of such entity.\nIt is submitted that it is No alleged in the SCN that I have monetarily benefited in any manner from such alleged manipulation.\nFor the 1Otrades executed by me in the scrip of STAL the following were the counter parties buyers to my trades i.\nMitul Jagdish Vora; ii.\nJignasaJayesh Shah; iii.\nVipul Rajendrabhai Gandhi; iv PremLataNahar; v.\nChandrkantLaddha It is important to note that none of the above mentioned entities have been issued SCN by SEBI or any violation of any PFUTP Regulation is alleged against them.\nIn this regard the Honble Tribunal in the matter of Vikas Ganshmal Bengani vs  WTM SEBI has inter alia held as follows 5..\nWe have heard the appellant in person and Dr. Mrs. Poomima Advani Ad vocate on behalf of the Board who have taken us through the record s including the show cause notice and the impugned order and are of the view that the charges of manipulation as levelled against the appellant have No been established.\nMerely because an investor like the appellant placed orders for the purchase of a scrip at a price higher than the last traded price does No by itself lead to the conclusion that the was manipulating the price of the scrip.\nThere could be several good reasons for an investor to do this.\nFor instance an informed investor in a given case may feel that the fundamentals of a company justify a higher price than the one at which the scrip is trading in the market he may like to place is buy orders at a higher price so as to attract all the sellers in the market……………………………………….A similar view was taken Adjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd by this Tribunal in Ketan Parikh v.\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India Appeal No 2 of 2004 decid ed on 14.7.2006…………….\nA similar issue arose before this Tribunal in Jagruti Securities Limited Vs.\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India Appeal No 102 of 2006 decided on October 27 2008 and it was held that for the charge of raising price artificially to be established the element of collusion between the buyer and the seller is a sine quanon……………….”\nIn view of the above when the counter parties to my trades have No been alleged of any violation and there is no allegation of any collusion or meeting of minds with such entities I cannot be held have violated the said PFUTP Regulations specifically with respect to manipulating the price of the scrip of STAL.\nIt is No even the case of SEBI that I have executed circular or synchronized trades therefore merely based on the connection and the LTP contributed by me which is miniscule it cannot be alleged that I have violated the PFUTP Regulations.\nFor proving a charge of PFUTP Regulation violation a stronger higher degree of proof or evidence is required.\nIn this

of manipulation of the price of the scrip of STIL is sought to be established by the Board on the basis of only three trades executed by the appellant on 09.8.2000 28.08.2000 and 20.09.2000 on BSE……..All these sales were at prices alread y determined through the priceor der matching mechanism of the stock exchange and no trade was executed at such a price could be said to b e manipulative

v.\nRegulation 41  The SCN fails to demonstrate as to how my acts were fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities market.\nThe only allegation against me is that I have been alleged to be part of a group and the group had contributed to positive LTP in the scrip of STAL. vi.\nRegulation 42a  The trades executed by me were delivery based transactions and it is also nowhere mentioned in the SCN as to how such trades have created false or misleading appearance of trading in the scrip of STAL. vii.\nRegulation 42e  Trades executed by me have only contributed Rs 11.35to the LTP in the

request your goodself to grant an opportunity of personal hearing before passing of any Orders in the matter and I crave leave to file Additional Submissions if so required.”\nKey submissions of Bhagwat Singh Kitawat in the reply dated April 16 2018 “In furtherance to which my authorized representative vide email dated 22d March 2018 had sought the documents relied upon by SEBI Adjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd whi le issuing the captioned SCN including the Investigation Report with all the annexures and also the complete Order Logso as to enable me to file a detailed reply to the captioned SCN.\nHowever SEBI vide email dated 5th Apri l 2018 rejected the said request and granted time till 19th April 2018 to file a reply before your goodself and a second opportunity of personal hearing on 20th Apri l 2018.\nTherefore based on the limited data documents available with me I am filing this present reply.\nIn the SCN it has been alleged against me that I along with other entities alleged connected group indulged in trades in minuscule quantities repeatedly at price higher than LTP during 17th September 2013 to 17th November 2014 hereinafter referred to as Investigation Period Relevant Period resulting to manipulation of the price of the scrip of Svaraj thereby violating Regulation 3a b\n{c d41 42 and e of SEBI PFUTP Regulations2003.\nIn the SCN l have been called upon to show cause as to why an inquiry be No held against me in terms of Rule 4 of the SEBI Adjudicating Rules 1995 read with Section 15 I of the SEBI Act; and penalty be No imposed in terms of Rule S of the said Rules and the provisions of Section 15 HA of SEBI Act.\nThe present SCN has been issued to 8 entities including me and therefore I shall be only dealing with the violations as alleged against me or my acts which have been held to be violations to the above mentioned Regulations.\nI deny each and every statement allegation observation etc. made in the captioned SCN and nothing stated in the captioned SCN shall be deemed to be admitted by virtue of No having been specifically denied or dealt with unless the same has been expressly dealt with.\nIn the SCN I have been alleged to be connected to other entities who had traded in the scrip of Svaraj also the noticees in the present SCN.\nIt is submitted that the basis of connections are very farfetched and cannot be relied upon just because I had a common address with one  Mr Prakash Chandra Purohit does No means that I am connected to all the other entities mentioned above.\nThe reason for having a common address.\nThe onus shall be on SEBI to prove as to whether I was connected to all the entities mentioned above and also whether there was any prior meeting of minds or collusion with such entities to manipulate the price of the scrip of Svaraj.\nHowever no such exercise has been done by SEBI whi le issuing the present SCN.\nIn view of this it is submitted that the present proceedings against me shall be dropped based on this point only as there is no connection of mine with other entities as alleged in the SCN and therefore in furtherance the charge of any violation of PFUTP Regulation does No stand.\nI along with the other 7 entities have also been alleged to be connected with Svaraj and 5 of the 49 preferential allottees who had received shares in the preferential allotment dated 25th July 2013.\nIn this regard it is submitted that just because I am a director in Company wherein there are many other directors and one of those director is connected some third person or entity it does No means that Iam also connected to that third person or entity.\nBy this logic I will be alleged to be connected with thousands of entities.\nThis basis of connection established by SEBI is absurd and cannot stand any ground.\nIn any event whether I am connected to any number of entities or not the charge of manipulation should be established independently based on the trades and conduct or intention of each entity.\nIf all it is established that I was connected to the said 5 preferential allottees it is submitted that the ·preferential allotment on 25th July 2013 was made to 49 entities and if the said events scheme arti fice was fraudulent then it makes no difference whether I am connected to 5 out of 49 preferential allottees or not.\nIt is also important to note that none of the 49 preferential allottees including the 5 alleged to be connected to the noticees in the present SCN have been alleged to have violated any PFUTP Regulations No any show cause notice has been issued to the said 49 entities.\nIt makes no difference whether 4 of the 5 preferential allottees mentioned above were amongst the top 10 sellers in the scrip of Svaraj subsequent to the expiry period of the lockin period of shares allotted in preferential allotment.\nIf none of the 49 allottees have been alleged to have violated any PFUTP Regulation then there is no meaning of making such observation in the SCN.\nThe Honble Securities Appellate Tribunal in various Judgments has dealt with the situation where a noticee was alleged to be a part of an alleged group.\nExtracts of several relevant judgments are reproduced herein below Premchand Shah & Ors. vs  SEBIDate of decision 21 02 2011  5. .lt is No in dispute that the ap pellants as a group are inter se related connected to each other and that they except appellant No 1 have exited from the compan y by selling the shares held by them...\nThe question that we need to answer is whether the sale of shares by the appellants and the purchase thereof by the Ganatra group was collusive………………………….”\nNarendra Ganatra vs  SEBI Date of decision 29 07 2011It is the case of Appellant that he had No indulged in any fraudulent or unfair trade practice while dealing in the scrip of the company.\nAll his transactions were carried out through the stock exchange mechanism during trading hours and were executed at the then prevailing market price………….\nWe are unable to accept the arguments of Learned Counsel for the Board.\nEven the Adjudicating Officer while passing the impugned order has No b e e n able to bring any evidence on record to Indicate nexus of the Appellant with other group entities and has inferred the collusion from attending circumstances…………………………………… In the absence of any evidence on record direct or circumstantial against the Appellant in manipulating the trades or raising the price of the scrip he deserves to be given the benefit of doubt.\nSmitaben N.Shah vs  SEBI Date of decision 30 07 2010 We cannot lose sight of the fact that a serious charge like fraudulent trading cannot be established on the basis of these tenuous and farfetched connection.\nIn this view of the matter we Adjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd have no hesitation to hold that the appellants did No act in tandem with any of the entities referred to in Annexure 2 as alleged in the show cause notice and found by the whole time member.\nNo dealing with the trades executed by me in the scrip of Svaraj it is submitted that all the trades executed by me were in normal course of business and no fraudulent or manipulative practice can be alleged against me for such trades.\nThere is no evidence or finding in the SCN that I was colluding with the other alleged group entities or there was a prior meeting of minds to manipulate the price of the scrip of Svaraj.\nThe SCN has been issued based on mere surmises and conjectures without any iota of evidence against me based on which I have been alleged to have violated the said PFUTP Regulation.\nA charge of market manipulation is a very serious violation which should be supported with higher degree of evidence.\nOnly based onq farfetched connection the present SCN has been issued to me.\nIt has also been alleged in the SCN that I have sold shares in miniscule quantity ranging from 1 – 5 shares against existing buy orders for larger quantities.\nIn this regard it is submitted that the lot size of the scrip of Svaraj is 1and therefore it is upon the buyer or seller to place the order quantity at their own wish and No depending on the counter partys order quantity.\nIn any event the charge of manipulation cannot be based on the order quantity of any entity it has to be based on the trades or the trading pattern of such entity.\nIn any event it is No alleged in the SCN that I have benefited in any manner from such alleged manipulation.\nFor the 9 trades executed by me in the scrip of Svarajthe following were the counter parties buyers to my trades i.\nSanjiv Kumar; ii.\nMahesh Kumar Taparia; iii.\nVipul Rajendrabhai Gandhi; iv.\nMitul Jagdish Vora It is important to note that none of the above mentioned entities have been issued by SEBI or any violation of any PFUTP Regulation is alleged against them.\nIn this regard the Honble Tribunal in the matter of Vikas Ganshmal Bengani vs  WTMSEBI has inter alia held as follows5..\nWe have heard the appellant in person and Dr. Mrs. Poomima Advani Ad vocate on behalf of the Board who have taken us through the record s including the show cause notice and the impugned order and are of the view that the charges of manipulation as levelled against the appellant have No been established.\nMerely because an investor like the appellant placed orders for the purchase of a scrip at a price higher than the last traded price does No by itself lead to the conclusion that the was manipulating the price of the scrip.\nThere could be several good reasons for an investor to do this.\nFor instance an informed investor in a given case may feel that the fundamentals of a company justify a higher price than the one at which the scrip is trading in the market he may like to place is buy orders at a higher price so as to attract all the sellers in the market……………………………………….A similar view was taken by this Tribunal in Ketan Parikh v.\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India Appeal No 2 of 2004 decid ed on 14.7.2006…………….\nA similar issue arose before this Tribunal in Jagruti Securities Limited Vs.\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India Appeal No 102 of 2006 decided on October 27 2008 and it was held that for the charge of raising price artificially to be established the element of collusion between the buyer and the seller is a sine quanon……………….”\nIn view of the above when the counter parties to my trades have No been alleged of any violation and there is no allegation of any collusion or meeting of minds with such entities 1 ·cannot be held have violated the said PFUTP Regulations specifically with respect to manipulating the price of the scrip of Svaraj.\nIt is No even the case of SEBI that I have executed circular or synchronized trades therefore merely based on the connection and the LTP contributed by me which is miniscule it cannot be alleged that I have violated the PFUTP Regulations.\nFor proving a charge of PFUTP Regulation violation a stronger higher degree of proof or evidence is required.\nIn this regard the Honble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the matter of KSL & Industries Ltd vs  Chairman SEBI Appeal No 9 of 2003 vide order dated September 30 2003 has inter alia held that A wild allegation of market manipulation in particular the charge of fraudulent action unsupported with convincing evidence is No to be sustained.\nI fully agree with Shri Khambatta ssubmission in this regard that a legation of 1raud cannot survive on mere conjectures and surmises.\nAlso in the matter of Kapil Chatrabhuj Bhuptani vs  SEBI Appeal No 95 of 2013 the Honble Tribunal vide order dated 10th October 2013 has inter alia held as follows 7.\nTherefore in our considered opinion simple trading by the appellant in a particular scrip without any proved nexus between trades with the other so called group of brokers and clients is No per se punishable..\nAlso in the matter of HB Stock Holdings Ltd vs  SEBI\n{Appeal No 114 of 2012 the Honble Tribunal vide order dated 2ih August 2013 has inter alia held as follows 17..There has to be sufficient evidence on record to clearly prove connivance on the part of the Appellants with a counter party to prove the charge in question against the Appellants.\nIn the absence of any such evidence and unambiguous findings by the learned WTM to this effect we have no option but to quash the impugned order in question.\nAlso in the matter of Jagruti Securities Ltd vs  SEBI the Honble Tribunal vide order dated 27th October 2008 has inter alia held as follow4...\nIf the trades buy orders had been genuinely executed by the appellant as a broker through the trading system of the two exchanges where is then the question of the appellant artificially raising the price of the scrip………………………”.\nA similar view was taken by this Tribunal in Ketan Parikh v.\nSecurities and Exchange Board of Indta Appeal No 2 of 2004 decided on 14.7.2006.\nThe charge levelled ·against the appellant therein was that he had indulged in manipulating upwards the price of the scrip of Lupin Laboratori es Ltd and the same was established on the basis of charts showing that buy orders had been placed at prices higher than the last traded price.\nWhile reversing the order of the Board this Tribunal observed that merely because some buy orders had been placed at prices higher than the last traded price in the scrip would No lead to the inference that the price was being manipulated upwards.\nIt could Adjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd indicate the desire of the ap pellant to purchase the shares and it is with that object in view that he may have put in buy orders at the higher rate.\nThe Board did No challenge the findings recorded by the Tribunal.\nAlso in the matter of Moneygrowth Investment and Consultants Pvt Ltd vs  SEBI the Honbe Tribunal vide Order dated 27th August 2008 has inter alia held as follows 5.\nThe main charge of manipulation of the price of the scrip of STIL is sought to be established by the Board on the basis of only three trades executed by the appellant on 09.08.2000 28.08.2000 and 20.09.2000 on BSE.\nEach of the trades was a sale of 50 shares and while the price on 09.08.2000 was Rs 75.55 per share on 28.08.2000 and further to Rs 366.40 per share on 20.09.2000.\nAll these sales were at prices already determined through the price order matching mechanism of the stock exchange and no trade was executed at such a pric e could be said to be manipulative in nature unless there is a charge of circular or synchronized trading.\nNo dealing with the alleged violations of the SEBIPFUTP Regulations 2003 by me i.\nRegulation 3a The trades

the scrip of Svaraj out of the total LTP of Rs 139.36 i.e  only 6.8% and they were genuine trades without any intention to manipulate the price of the scrip.\nIn view of the submissions made above no

each of their trades do No hold water.\nThe very fact that matching of order have taken place after a gap of half an hour to 5 1 2 hrs as reflected in order logs trade logs show that there was no prior meeting of minds and the trading was system driven technical and of no consequence to Noticee and counterparty.\nAnalysis of trade logs scripwise sauda summary in CD i.\nThe Noticee states that during the inspection period the Noticee has traded only on 10 days. ii.\nThere is huge significant difference in order ‘keyin’ time of buyer and seller. iii.\nAll sell orders of the Noticee were limit orders. iv.\nThe trading in the scrip of STAL is under continuous surveillance supervision. v.\nThe demand in the scrip of STAL had been curbed due to restrictions imposed on the trading in the scrip at the relevant time.\nThe scrip was in ‘T’ group at the relevant time. vi.\nOrders for buying has been placed prior to the Noticee’s sell orders. vii.\nThe Noticee states that “First market reflect reality then market reacts too reality”.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd The Noticee thus denies that the connected group had matched the prices of prevailing buy orders which were placed at a higher price than the last traded price and thus contributed to the increased scrip price with each of their trades.\nThus the Noticee could No have said to have contributed to positive LTP as it was the buyers price which was prevailing in the market.\nThe Noticee states that all sell orders of the Noticee were limit orders.\nA limit order is a direction given to a broker to buy and sell a security or commodity at a specified price or better.\nA buy limit order can only be executed at the limit price or lower.\nA sell limit order can only be executed at a limit price or higher.\nA limit order can be only filled if the stock’s market price reaches the limit price.\nThe Noticee further says that she has No received any disproportionate gain or unfair advantage and has No caused any loss to an investor or group of investors.\nThe Noticee says that she is No guilty of conduct which is contumacious or dishonest or acted in conscience disregard of law or that she acted in defiance of law.\nThe Noticee further says that the trading system does No make available the particulars – such as quantity of shares prices and time – of counter party’s keyedin orders against which my orders got matched.\nIn the absence of these particulars we could No know or ascertain any pattern at the relevant time.\nOn the contrary it shows that the minds of the dealers concerned were No ad idem and there was no prior collaboration of any kind inter se.\nThe Noticee’s case is grossly covered by an order dated 26.04.2018 of SEBI’s Hon’ble AO in the matter of Dhenu Buildcon infra limited which has held at para 21 vii as follows  I note that the Noticee had placed all its sell orders when there was pending buy orders at upper Adjudication Order in respect of Jayant Indulal Sethna in the matter of Dhenu Buildcon Infra Ltd. circuit limits on respective trading days.\nFurther I also note that buy orders were placed and available at start of the trading session i.e  915 AM.\nI note that sell orders of Noticee were placed within 1 to 2 hours from the placement of buy orders and executed subsequently which resulted in establishing of LTP.\nIn respect of these trades the allegation of price manipulation for creation of LTP cannot be attributable to the Noticee just because there was no subsequent sell orders available in the market.\nThe Noticee also relies upon the Hon’ble AO’s order dated 26.12.2017 in the matter of KGN Enterprise Ltd which has held at para 66 as follows “I do No find the Noticees responsible for contribution to LTP through first trades as in most of the cases buy orders were placed by the Noticees at the prevailing sell order prices which were already there in the market at prices higher than LTP and counter parties to the trades with the Noticees were also scattered.\nTherefore Noticees also cannot be held responsible for contribution to LTP through first trades”.\nThe Noticee requests that she be provided with the Investigation Report and order log of the entire market for the period 03.03.2014 to 14.03.2014.\nThe Noticee craves leave to file additional submissions after receipt of inspection reports and order logs if required.\nMITIGATING FACTORS i The Noticee acted in good faith and was No aware of wrongdoings if any of others. ii There is change in beneficial ownership of the shares. iii The Noticee has No taken regulatory proceedings in a nonchalant manner. iv The alleged violation is No repetitive in nature.\nPRAYER In the circumstances since this reply of the Noticee demolishes the allegations against me it is humbly prayed that there is no case for any further actions in regard to the charges levied vide the impugned SCN and accordingly the matter be closed at your end.”\nPersonal hearing 16.\nAuthorised representatives of  Mr Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta  Mr Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria  Mr Prakash Chandra Purohit  Mr Bhagwat Singh Kitawat and Ms. Neha B

Sohanlalji Gupta received in his letter and email from his authorised representative both dated May 15 2018 “It is submitted that it is a matter of great anguish that my request to allow me inspection of the related documents including Investigation Report with Annexure in the above said matter was rejected .\nThis is the gross violation of principle of Natural Justice.\nIn this regard I rely the Order dated 15062010 passed by the Honble Tribunal in Appeal No . 281 of 2009.\nThus the Principle of Natural Justice has No been followed in the present Adjudicating Proceeding.\nIt is further submitted that despite the discrepancies in Price Volume data and Trade Log data brought into the attention of your goodself I am still No explained about the said inconsistencies.\nThe difference in Price Volume data and Trade Log data raised serious questions on the genuineness of the Trade data.\nIt is further submitted that in the similar circumstances in a different scrip another Adjudicating Officer had disposedoff the SCN without passing any adverse order against the concern Noticee .\nI rely the Order dated 26042018 passed by Ld.\nAdjudicating Officer Sri B J Dilip against  Mr Jayant Indulal Sethna in the matter of Dhanu Buildcon Infra Limited.\nAdmittedly I have no connection relation with the counterparties to my trades.\nMy all Orders were placed at prevailing market price and buyer Adjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd orders were already exist in the screen.\nNo recommendation have been made against the counterpartys buyer to my sell trades.\nThe quantum of trades executed by me were far less than the trades executed in the above mentioned matter.\nAO must have to consider another AO Order Hon ble Tribunal by Order dated 07082014 in Appeal No 204 of 2014 observed that In an Adjudication proceedings if a party relies on adjudication order passed in an another case then judicial discipline demands that the Adjudicating Officer considers that order and thereafter passes an order either to follow or distinguish the earlier order or disagree with the order by recording reasons as to how that order is erroneous and ought No to be followed.\nIt is also submitted that the price of the given scrip is governed by the demand and supply.\nFurther the demand and supply in a given scrip are governed by lots of factors.\nThe suspension from trading on BSE in the scrip of Svaraj was revoked after 9 years later from the date of suspension.\nAfter revocation of the suspension the scrip was thinly traded as supply was No adequate to the demand.\nIf the price of the scrip rose artificially during the period of Examination then the price should have been collapsed after the said period.\nHowever the price of the scrip has increased after the period of examination and still stable around Rs 200 .\nThus no fraud has been committed due to increase in the price of the scrip and no investors has made loss in the scrip of Svaraj.\nIt is clarified that I have no connection and relation with  Mr Laxman Diwan except the purchase of shares in off market.\nI am No facing any SEBI Proceeding in any scrip except Svaraj.\nI had purchased shares from  Mr Laxman Diwan and  Mr Mukesh Mohan Agarwal in off market transactions and sold the same in market.\nIt is an admitted fact that both have No made parties to the SCN.\nSince  Mr Laxman Diwan and  Mr Mukesh Mohan Agarwal have No made parties to the SCN who had made transfer in the shares of Svaraj I should also be exonerated on this sole ground.\nI therefore once again pray to your goodself to consider my aforesaid submissions and dispose of the SCN without passing any adverse order against me.”\n2 Additional written submissions of Prakash Chandra Purohit received in his letter and email from his authorised representative both dated May 16 2018 “At the hearing held on 09 05 2018 the Ld.\nAdjudicating Officer had directed the Authorised Representative to submit the Additional Written Submissions with respect to connection if any with  Mr Laxman Diwan off market transactions and dealing in other scrips.\nWith reference to the above information sought by the Ld.\nAdjudicating Officer it is submitted that my connection with  Mr Laxman Diwan who is No a party to the present Show Cause Notice is only to the extent that we are business partners and I was a Director in Miraj Products Private Limited and have already resigned as a Director of the said Company.\nFurther there are no other inter se scrip trading between me and  Mr Laxman Diwan.\nIt is further submitted that this Honble Investigating Agency has No provided a copy of my Demat Account in the said Show Cause Notice and moreover I have been denied the inspection of the Investigation Report and annexures thereto and therefore I have been deprived of availing and or perusing the documents based on which the purported allegations in the said Show Cause Notice have been made against me.\nIt is further submitted that by denying the inspection of investigation report the principle of natural justice has been violated and I have been made to file my reply and or representation on the limited information provided in the said Show Cause Notice .\nIt is reiterated that I had sold a total of 13 shares in 9 trades in positive LTP and 1 trade of 50 shares in Zero LTP.\nFurther on my selling the shares held by me the price of the share has increased and the price of the said share is still trading at a higher value as on date which is evident from the Price Data available on the BSE website.\nI further rely on the Order dated 26 04 2018 passed by the Ld.\nAdjudicating Officer in the respect of Jayant Indulal Sethna under Section 15I of SEBI Act 1992 read with Rule 5 of SEBI Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer Rules 1995.\nIn the said Order the Ld.\nAdjudicating Officer has found that 21v.\nI find from the trade log that the buy orders were placed and pending at the upper circuit filter on the 34 trading d ays i.e  from December 1 1 201 1 to April 10 2012 wherein the Noticee was alleged to have made significant contribution to LTP.\nThe sell ord ers were placed by the Noticee at the available upper circuit filter.\nI am of the view that mere selling of shares at the upper circuit filter cannot be faulted for especially when the Noticee is No connected to the promo ters and no consistent pattern of same buyers as counterparties for the aforesaid trades were found.\n21vi.I am of the view that in illiquid scnp with miniscule volume and the less number of trades as in this case it is relevant to examine the timing of execution of the trades.\nIt is also imperative that for a trade to happen on any trading day in an illiquid stock having buying pressure the timing of execution of trad e triggered by a seller is necessary for establishing price on that day.\nI note from the analysis of the trading pattern of the Noticee for the period December 11 2011 to April 10 2012 wherein the Noticee was alleged to have mad e significant contribution to LTP that the Noticee had placed sell order for 1 share each in 29 trades and 5 shares each in 5 trades totalling 54 shares in 34 trades.\nDuring the relevant period the total market volume was 299 shares in 43 trades.\nI note that the Noticee had placed all its sell orders when there was pending buy ord ers at upper circuit limits on respective trading d ays.\nFurther I also note that buy orders were placed and available at start of the trading session i.e  915 AM .\nI note that sell orders of Noticee were placed within 1 to 2 hours from the placement of buy orders and executed subsequentl y which resulted in establishing of LTP.\nIn respect of these trades the Adjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd allegation of price manipulation for creation of LTP cannot be attributable to the Noticee j ust because there was no subsequent sell orders available in the market.\nFrom th aforesaid findings visavis the charges levelled against the Noticee in the SCN I find that the Noticee had executed his trades in normal course of business.\nFurther there is nothing to establish any connivance of the Noticee with the connected group and the promoters of DBIL.\nI note that the sale of shares by the Noticee were in accord ance with the market practice and mechanism.\nThe method and manner in which the trades were executed by the Noticee does No establish any motive of fraudulent intent to manipulate the price of DBIL scrip.\nIt is further submitted that the above Order is squarely applicable to the Show Cause Notice issued to me and further the said Show Cause Notice fails to prove my connivance with any of the Noticee and or the Promoters who were issued further shares by the Company.”\nIt is humbly requested to take the aforesaid facts into consideration at the time of adjudicating the said Show Cause Notice.”\n3 Additional written submissions of Bhagwat Singh Kitawat received in his letter and e mail from his authorised representative both dated May 16 2018 “900 shares of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd were acquired by me in the year 2012 before the starting of the Investigation Period and were later dematerialized in my account on 23102013.\nAnother Ld.\nAdjudicating Officer of SEBI in the matter of Dhenu Buildcon Infra Ltd. in similar facts and circumstances of the present case has disposed off the SCN issued to the  Mr Jayant lndulal Sethna.\nThe relevant portion of the Order dated 26th April 2018 passed in the matter of Dhenu Buildcon Infra Ltd is reproduced herein under 22..I note that the sale of shares by the Noticee were in accordance with the market practice and mechanism.\nThe method and manner in which the trades were executed by the Noticee does No establish any motive of fraudulent intent to manipulate the price of DBI L scrip.\nIn view of the foregoing I find that the charge of Noticee indulging in manipulating the price of DBIL scrip has No been established.\nNo dealing with respect to the allegation that I was connected with other entities who have allegedly contributed to the positive LTP of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd Without prejudice to the submissions already made in the letter dated 16th April2018 it is submitted that if at all it is established that I was connected to other entities who have also contributed to the positive LTP it does No means that was in collusion with such entities was increasing the price of the scrip.\nThere is no allegation in the SCN that I had received shares from any of the alleged connected entities or I had executed any selftrades or synchronized trades within the group.\nIt is important to mention that there is no allegation of meeting of minds or collusion with other alleged connected entities.\nAt the time the sell orders were placed by me large buy orders were already pending on the exchange.\nNo action has been taken by SEBI against the entities who had placed buy orders at such prices and therefore it does No matter whether any individual sells 1share or 1000 shares what is to be s een is whether such trade was with an intent to manipulate the price of the scrip.\nIt is pertinent to note that the price of the scrip of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd in todays date around Rs 200  That means the price at which I had traded were No artificial No were with an intent to increase the price of the scrip.\nAlso the Honble Securties Appellate Tribunal in a recent Judgment dated 18th Apri l2018 in the matter of Ashlesh Shah vs  SEBI Appeal No 265 of 2017 has inter alia held as follows11.\nHowever mere fact that the appellant belonged to Kripa Soni group could No be a ground to hold that the single buy order placed by the appellant on 06.04.2010 to buy 7700 shares of RCL was with a view to create an artificial momentum in the illiquid scrip of RCL.\nIn view of the submissions made above and the submissions made vide letter dated 16th Apri l 2018 it is prayed that the captioned SCN be disposed off against me without issuing any further directions or imposing any monetary penalty.”\n4 Additional submissions of Neha B Raval in her letter dated May 28 2018 “Relevant summary of facts for Rakhi Trading 1.During the hearing held on 9th May 2018 the Authorized Representative of the Noticce was asked to differentiate between the judgment of the Hon ble Supreme Cou rt of India in the matter of

forth their reply to the SCN in view of the allegations levelled against them however no reply has been received by them No did they avail any of the three opportunities of hearing granted to them.\nIn view of the above present proceedings are carried further based on material available on record.\nTECHNICAL ISSUES RAISED BY NOTICEES 20 Before going to the issues and findings it would be pertinent to address certain common technical issues raised by the Noticees same are addressed as follows Adjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd 20.1 Copy of all the documents in the present matter including investigation report No provided to Noticees Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Prakash Chandra Purohit and Bhagwat Singh Kitawat requested for providing copy of all the documents records in the present matter against the Noticees including copy of investigation report and annexure to the same.\nIt is noted that all the relevant investigation findings pertaining to the Noticees along with tradeorder log relied upon for allegation of price manipulation the copies of KYC documents information from MCA website etc relied upon for allegations against the Noticees have been provided in the SCN issued toNoticeesIn this regard Noticees were informed that “Relevant findings information and supporting documents including tradeorder log being relied upon in the present proceedings have already been provided in the SCN issued toNoticeesThere is no other information document being relied upon further in the present proceedings”.\nHence above issue require no further consideration as all the information records related to the Noticees relied upon in the present proceedings have been provided to Noticees in the SCN.\nFurther information which is No available to Noticees in general course or as a matter of public records is No relied upon in the present proceedings in respect of theNoticees20.2 Mismatch of No of trades in Price volume table and tradeorder log provided to Noticees in the SCN Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta and Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria drew attention towards mismatch in “no. of trades” reflected in daily price volume table and in the tradeorder log both provided along with the SCN as annexure D and F respectively and alleged contradictions and confusion so as to which data to rely.\nOn perusal of price volume data provided in Annexure D it is noted that the same do No reflect correct “No. of trades” as in few instances even 2 trades during a day have shown resulting into trade with volume of 1 share.\nAs regards to trade log data provided in Annexure F no factual errors are noted.\nOn the question that if the above error in the annexure D has created confusion it is noted that only point 7 of the SCN make reference to price volume data provided in annexure D and that too for referring the daily movement in price and volume no. of shares and no reference is made to “no. of trades” mentioned therein.\nThis fact is substantiated from the content of said point 7 which states that “During relevant period price of the scrip at BSE rose from Rs 7.14 to Rs 146.50 with daily avg. of 2 shares.\nDetails of price & volume movement during investigation period are provided in Annexure D”.\nHence from the above it is clear that there is no reference made to “no. of trades” in the Annexure D. Trade log data provided in the Annexure F for reference of Noticees covers all the trades that happened in the shares of STAL during the investigation period and “no. of trades” mentioned in points 8 and 14 of the SCN are verifiable from the said trade log data provided in Annexure F and no discrepancy is noted in relation to the same.\nAdjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd Hence it is clear that no attention has been invited or reference made in the SCN towards said “no. of trades” mentioned in the price volume table in annexure D and any attention drawn to the same is uncalled for.\nCONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 21.\nOn perusal of the material available on record and giving regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and submissions of the Noticees following issues require consideration in the present matter followed by findings in this respect a Whether the Noticees manipulated the price of the shares of STAL at Stock Exchange during the relevant period and thereby violated Regulation 3abcd 41 42a and e of PFUTP Regulations 2003? b Does the violation if any on part of the Noticees attract monetary penalty under Section 15HA of SEBI Act? c If so what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act?\nIt is appropriate to refer to the provisions

Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd viz Bhagwat Singh Kitawat who happen to be one of the Directors of Bhagyadeep Enterprises Pvt Ltd in which Madan Lal Paliwal a preferential allottee of STAL and Rajeev Sharma one of the Director in STAL were also Director.\nFurther Bhagwat Singh Kitawat is also connected with Madan Lal Paliwal HUF based on common address and indirectly connected with three other preferential allottees viz Raghav Securities MPK Equity Research LLP and Prakash Equity Services LLP.\nAs regards to alleged connection of Noticees with the said 5 preferential allottees it is noted that the present matter involves allegations against the Noticees for price manipulation at the Stock Exchange.\nThough the allegation of connection of Noticees with said 5 preferential allottees and with the STAL is made however there is no allegation conclusion of collusion of Noticees with them in the alleged price manipulation.\nHence this issue require no further consideration.\nAs regards to the allegation of Noticees forming a connected group Noticees have denied the allegation of forming a connected group and have contended that charges against them should be established independently.\nIt is also contended by Noticees that they should No be deemed to be connected as a group based on their individual connections and connection with Laxman Diwan.\nIt is further contended that when Laxman Diwan and another transferor of shares in offmarket viz Mukesh Mohanlal Agarwal were No made party to the said allegations against the Noticees they should also be exonerated from the allegations.\nShekhar D Vaishnav in its reply in the hearing has submitted that he himself has No operated his trading account while dealing in shares of STAL and as the dealing through his trading demat account was undertaken by some other person he should No be made accountable for alleged violations against him.\nOn perusal of allegation and supporting evidence information it is noted that Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta is directly connected to Anil Vishnu Bharti and Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia as the former transferred shares through offmarket to the latter two.\nFurther Prakash Chandra Purohit and Bhagwat Singh Kitawat are directly connected as they share common address.\nIt is pertinent to note that in an offmarket transaction of shares through depository system seller transferor and buyer transferee know the identity of each other and also common address among entities also point towards connection among the said entities.\nAs regards to remaining Noticees viz Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Neha B Raval Shekhar D Vaishnav it is noted that though as per information on record they were No found directly connected to each other or with other Noticees however they along with Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta acquired shares from one person viz Laxman Diwan hence fom part of the connected group.\nPrakash Chandra Purohit was a director in a company viz Miraj Products Pvt Ltd with said Laxman Diwan and thereby both Prakash Chandra Purohit and Bhagwat Adjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd Singh Kitawat form part of the connected group.\nThe above basis reasonably put the Noticees as a connected group.\nAs per records role of both Laxman Diwan and Mukesh Mohanlal Agarwal in the matter is limited to the fact that 4 of the Noticees acquired shares in offmarket from them however they have No dealt in shares of STAL at Stock Exchange during the relevant period.\nFurther there is no allegation or evidence as well as submission by Noticees on record stating that Laxman Diwan and Mukesh Mohanlal Agarwal acted along with the Noticees while dealing in shares of STAL at the Stock Exchange.\nAs regards to Noticees present matter alleges that Noticees being allegedly connected group dealt in the shares of STAL at BSE Stock Exchange during the relevant period and through their allegedly common trading behaviour they manipulated the price of the shares of STAL at BSE.\nThe said common trading behaviour includes consistently executing trades above the LTP on most of the occasions in miniscule quantities mostly comprising 1 to 5 shares despite heavy demand on buy side and availability of more shares with them.\nHence for the dealing in shares of STAL at BSE it is appropriate to make Noticees accountable if the allegations against them are established.\nAs regards to the contention of Shekhar D Vaishnav it is noted that Shekhar D Vaishnav is aware of dealing through his trading and demat account however he has contended that same was done by some other person.\nHowever given that no complaint has been filed by him for any unauthorised usage the same even if the case be is an agreed upon arrangement.\nGiven the above Shekhar D Vaishnav is responsible for dealing in shares of STAL during the relevant period.\nAs regards to contention of Noticees that they are No part of a group and their trading should be considered on individual bases it is to be mentioned that connection of the group has been determined above and it is pertinent to note that in circumstances involving lack of direct more conclusive evidence a secondary evidence and reasonable probability has to be taken into consideration to conclude the matter.\nIn this regard reliance is placed upon judgement of honble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI Vs Kishore R. Ajmera in Civil Appeal No 2818 of 2008 decided on February 23 2016 wherein it was held that “It is a fundamental principle of law that proof of an allegation levelled against a person may be in the form of direct substantive evidence or as in many cases such proof may have to be inferred by a logical process of reasoning from the totality of the attending facts and circumstances surrounding the allegations charges made and levelled.\nWhile direct evidence is a more certain basis to come to a conclusion yet in the absence thereof the Courts cannot be helpless.\nIt is the judicial duty to take note of the immediate and proximate facts and circumstances surrounding the events on which the charges allegations are founded and to reach what would appear to the Court to be a reasonable conclusion therefrom.\nThe test would always be that what inferential process that a reasonable prudent man would adopt to arrive at a conclusion.”\nAdjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd 44.\nReliance is also placed on the order of Hon’ble SAT in the matter of Bhavesh Patel and Others versus SEBI in the matter of S J Corporation Limited in Appeal No 456 of 2015 decided on 25 April 2018 which reaffirmed the ratio cited in the matter of SEBI vs  Rakhi Trading Private Ltd Civil Appeal No 1969 of 2011 decided on February 08 2018 and SEBI vs  Kishore R. Ajmera in Civil Appeal No 2818 of 2008 decided on February 23 2016 and observed that “…. 44.\nLearned Counsel Shri.\nGaurav Joshi relied on the following judgments of the Supreme Court a Securities and Exchange Board of India vs  Rakhi Trading Private Ltd Civil Appeal No 1969 of 2011 decided on February 08 2018; b Securities and Exchange Board of India vs Shri Kanaiyalal Baldevbhai Patel 2017 SCC On Line SC 1148 decided on September 20 2017 and c Securities and Exchange Board of India vs  Kishore R. Ajmera 2016 6 Supreme Court Cases 368 decided on February 23 2016 and submitted that in deciding on PFUTP violation totality of facts and preponderance of probabilities have to be resorted to as full evidence may No be forthcoming and manipulative fraudulent schemes also include deliberately making losses as held in Rakhi Trading supra.\nArgument made by each of the appellant individually that each of them played only a small trade in isolation or as per normal course of their business or some of them did No trade at all or some small loan has been given etc stand no merit when totality of the picture is looked at.\nAll of them together enabled launching this major fraud by using a dormant low capital base and low public float company.\nIn this context we also find that the argument that many of the appellants did No offload either full or major chunk of their holding even in PhaseIII or thereafter also has no merit since with the still limited liquidity of about 1100 shares per day there was an inbuilt absorptive limitation for the market and thereafter the adinterim restraint order of the WTM of SEBI came on their way on February 5 2010.\nAs held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in several orders such as SEBI vs Rakhi Trading supra SEBI vs  Shri Kanaiyalal Baldevbhai supra and SEBI vs  Kishore R. Ajmera supra complete evidence may No be forthcoming in every such matter and what is needed is to prove that in a factual matrix preponderance of probabilities indicate a fraud.\nIn Rakhi Trading supra it is held that in some cases parties may even incur willful losses in the market to achieve some objectives.”\nUpon application of above stated principles to the present matter it is to be noted that in addition to the fact that Noticees form a group based on their direct and indirect connections Noticees have also alleged to have shown common trading behaviour while dealing in the shares of STAL at BSE during the relevant period.\nSaid common trading behaviour include consistently indulging into sale of miniscule quantities of shares of STAL at price higher than the LTP despite heavy demand for the shares of STAL on buy side and availability of more shares with theNoticeesSame is exhibited from following table Sl.\nEntity Name Seller No of Trade s No of +ve LT P trad es +ve

miniscule quantities upto 5 shares.\nFurther Noticees have shown common pattern wherein they placed sell order in miniscule quantities despite heavy demand on the buy side and also availability of more shares with them.\nFurther from the tradeorder log comprising all trades executed in shares of STAL at BSE during the relevant period which was also provided to the Noticees as annexure to the SCN it is noted that there were only 4 sale trades of Noticees which were undertaken for quantity of more than 5 shares viz 2 trades for 8 and 10 shares by Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria and 1 trade each by Bhagwat Singh Kitawat for 10 shares and Prakash Chandra Purohit for 50 shares.\nFurther from the tradeorder log it is pertinent to note that during relevant period from the total 159 days in which shares of STAL were traded Noticees dealt in 115 days selling mere 227 shares.\nIt is curious to find that during entire period of said 115 days on 113 trading days Adjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd only one person from the Noticees traded and on rest 2 days 2 persons from the Noticees traded on each day viz Bhagwat Singh Kitawat and Prakash Chandra Purohit traded on 31 03 2014 and Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria and Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia traded on 29 05 2014.\nThis shows the coordinated way in which the trading has been orchestrated by these noticees in the scrip during the relevant period.\nGiven the common trading behaviour and one person from the Noticees trading on a particular day shows that Noticees have dealt in tandem with each other and the same would No have been possible without meeting of minds.\nAs per information available on record following pattern is visible as regards to acquisition of shares in demat form by the Noticees and subsequent sale of the shares at BSE during the relevant period Sl.\nName of Noticee Details of acquisition of shares in demat form Date of first acquisition First day of sale at Stock Exchange

Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd Sl.\nName of Noticee Details of acquisition of shares in demat form Date of first acquisition First day of sale at Stock Exchange during relevant period Remarks based on information provided in SCN and reply received from Noticee 7 Neha B Raval 10 shares from Laxman Diwan through offmarket transaction 17 01 2014 03 03

Started sale of shares within 15 days of acquisition of shares in off market.\nFrom the above it is noted that 6 Noticees viz Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav acquired shares only up to 45 days prior from date when they started selling the same at Stock Exchange.\nAs regards to remaining 2 Bhagwat Singh Kitawat dematerialised shares on 23 10 2013 and started selling the same within around 2 months and as regards to Prakash Chandra Purohit information is No available on record that when he acquired the shares.\nHence 7 Noticees for which information is available on record did No held shares of STAL in their demat account for long time and sold the same in upto 2 months.\nRecords also shows that Prakash Chandra Purohit and Bhagwat Singh Kitawat sold less than 10% of shares held by them during the relevant period.\nMukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta who himself acquired total 97 shares in offmarket also further transferred 40 shares to 2 other Noticees viz Anil Vishnu Bharti and Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia which subsequently also undertaken same trading behaviour as shown by Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta.\nRecords also shows that Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia had already sold 2 shares at Stock Exchange before even receiving the same in his demat account and defaulted on delivery of 2 shares.\nSimilarly Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria sold 52 shares at Stock Exchange during relevant period despite the fact that he did No had holding of more than 25 shares in his demat account resulting into defaulted on delivery of 27 shares.\nGiven that there was hardly any trading prior to the relevant period there were very few sellers against the heavy demand on buy side in the shares of STAL at BSE during the relevant period.\nMukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta in his reply has contended that “besides my hol ding in the shares of Svaraj Trading and Agencies Lim ited hundreds of other entities hold the shares of the Compa ny.\nI had admi ttedly no control over the others holding and they were free to sell their shares to the buyer.\nIt is their choice that did No sel l t hei r shares during the Patch I.\nHow the Noticees to the SCN including me became responsible for No selling shares by the other shareholders of the company in reference?”.\nTaking note of the above contention it is peculiar that shareholders of STAL were No eager to sell their shares over a long period despite continuing heavy demand on buy side and sharply rising prices and result was that only few sellers were selling the shares and that too happened to be the Noticees Adjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd selling the shares in miniscule quantities.\nTo pursue the above contention of Noticee it is pertinent to look at the shareholding pattern of STAL around the relevant period.\nSaid shareholding pattern is publicly available at the website of BSE and reveals following pattern Quarter ending Category No of sharehold ers No of shares held %ge of total shareholding No of shares in Demat %shares in Demat 30Jun13 Promoters 3 61100 61.1 61100 100.00

2013 to end of September 2014 total No of shareholders of STAL remained at up to 122 shareholders. b There was increase in shareholders in quarter ending September 2013 which is also on account of preferential allotment of 14650000 shares to total 49 entities 3 promoters + 46 No promoters. c From the 122 shareholders there were even less No of shareholders which could have sold the shares of STAL due to following facts i At end of June 2013 effectively there were 3 shareholders which had shares in de mat or liquid form.\nRest 20 shareholders had shares in physical form. ii From the preferential shares allotted on July 25 2013 to 49 entities 13550000 shares shares allotted to 46 nonpromoters were under lock in till 25 07 2014 and 1100000 shares allotted to 3 promoters were under lockin till 25 07 2016. d Hence at least up to 25 07 2014 there effectively No more than 5060 shareholders which could have sold the shares of STAL.\nBased on the facts shown in subpoints a to d above it is clear that STAL was a tightly held company during the whole relevant period as there were around 122 shareholders in the Adjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd company and from the same during the relevant period upto July 25 2014 there were mere less than 5060 shareholders which had their shares in liquid form and could have possibly sold them.\nThis scenario is contrary to a general trend where a listed company is held by hundreds thousand lakhs of investors.\nThis scenario also weaken the contention of the Noticees that they should No be blamed if other shareholders chose No to sell the shares as Noticees seems to have exploited the scenario where with their irrational trading behaviour of trading in miniscule quantities consistently at higher LTP.\nHaving dominated the dealings in shares of STAL at sell side Noticees through their irrational trading behaviour which involve selling their limited possession of shares of STAL which was already scarce in the market consistently in miniscule quantities at the higher LTP to unsuspecting buyers have thereby actually given consistent rise in price of shares of STAL.\nThe above substantial price rise could No have been possible in absence of Noticees or if they had adopted a normal trading pattern.\nIn addition to the indirect and direct connections between the Noticees the common irrational trading behaviour and Noticees acting in tandem and concerted manner point towards collusion between them to manipulate the price of shares of STAL.\nNoticees in their replies have cited various judgements to counter the allegations and contend that there trades were executed in normal course and the same were No manipulative for reasons viz they merely sold the shares counterparty buyers were scattered no connection with counterparty buyers is found or alleged no allegations are made against counterparty buyers No undertaken any synchronised or circular trading etc.\nIt is pertinent to note that above points are No the basis of allegations against theNoticeesAs per allegations and subsequent findings recorded above Noticees have been able to effect price rise in the shares of STAL by selling scarce shares of STAL available in limited quantity with them consistently in miniscule quantities at higher LTP to unrelated and unsuspecting buyers.\nIn scenarios of the present case seller of shares do No necessarily require synchronised circular trades with counter parties or connection with the counter party buyers to manipulate the price as same was made possible by selling a scarce shares consistently in miniscule quantities at higher LTP.\nIt is also pertinent to note that 6 of the 8 Noticees had acquired the shares only 2 to 45 days before selling them in irrational manner.\nIt is also pertinent to note that Noticees have failed to demonstrate justifiable or believable reason for their irrational trading behaviour in shares of STAL during relevant period.\nInstead of providing justifiable reasons for their trading behaviour Noticees have tried to take shed of prior judgements involving different scenarios to justify their own trading behaviour.\nThe scenarios of the present matter do No draw any parallel with the cases quoted by Noticees in their replies except one adjudication matter viz adjudication order dated 26 04 2018 in Adjudication Order in respect of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta Rahul Kamalkant Parasrampuria Anil Vishnu Bharti Rajesh Jayantilal Savadia Prakash Chandra Purohit Bhagwat Singh Kitawat Neha B Raval and Shekhar D Vaishnav in the matter of Svaraj Trading & Agencies Ltd respect of  Mr Jayant Indulal Sethna in the matter of Dhanu Buildcom Infra Ltd Said adjudication order found that concerned Noticee therein undertaken trades in normal course.\nIn the said matter Noticee though had executed 34 trades in miniscule quantities against the pending buy orders and contributed to around 8% to the price rise however it is also found that Noticee was holding shares of the company for more than six years he acted alone and was No connected to neither connected entities and No connected to the promoter group.\nIn the present case it is noted that there is a connected group of 8 entities which made concerted efforts through their common irrational trading behaviour in specific scenarios of this case involving shares being tightly held and obtained by noticees No long ago giving substantial 77.8% of the total price rise during relevant period.\nHence upon perusal of the said adjudication matter visàvis the present case it is noted that scenarios of both cases are largely No the same.\nCommon trading behaviour and concerted efforts adopted by Noticees in the present matter clearly shows that there was a prior meeting of mind between Noticees at some level.\nFactually Noticees through their manipulative fraudulent dealing in shares of STAL during relevant period gave significant price rise of Rs 108.35 which is 77.8% of the total price rise of Rs 139.65. 62.\nHence it is clear that Noticees have acted in a fraudulent manner to give rise to the price of the shares of STAL during relevant period.\nThereby Noticees have violated provisions of Regulation 3abcd 41 and 42e of PFUTP Regulations 2003.\nIssue b – Does the violation if any on part of the Noticees attract monetary penalty under Section 15HA of SEBI Act?\nIt has been found above that Noticees as a connected group have acted in a fraudulent manner to give rise to the price of the shares of STAL during relevant period.\nThereby Noticees have violated provisions of Regulation 3abcd 41 and 42e of PFUTP Regulations 2003.\nThe above violation attract provisions of Section 15HA of SEBI Act which states as follows 88[Penalty for fraudulent and unfair trade practices.\nIf any person indulges in fraudulent and unfair trade practices relating to securities he shall be liable to a penalty 89[which shall No be less than five lakh rupees but which may extend to twenty  five crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of such practices whichever is higher].\n88 Inserted by the SEBI Amendment Act 2002 w.e.f29102002. 89 Substituted for the words ―twentyfive crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of such failure whichever is higher by the Securities Laws Amendment Act 2014 w.e.f 08092014 64.\nIn this respect reliance is also placed on order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI Vs.\nShri Ram Mutual Fund [2006] 68 SCL 216SC where

and Regulation 134 134A read with regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992; ii JCM HUF violated provisions of Regulation 134A read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992; iii JPA violated

violations attract monetary penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act? c If yes what quantum of monetary penalty should be imposed on the Noticees taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act?\nFINDINGS Alleged failure to make requisite disclosure upon change in shareholding of JCM and JCM HUF in view of interse transfer of 150000 shares of MIL on 29 11 2012 10.\nJCM Director and promoter of MIL transferred 150000 shares on November 29 2012 in an interse transfer of shares from another promoter viz JCM HUF.\nOn account of the said inter se transfer of shares it has been alleged that the JCM and JCM HUF had change in their shareholding and they failed to make the disclosure of said change in their holding in violation of the provisions of Regulation 134 and 134A read with Regulation 135 of PIT Regulations 1992.\nUnder the present adjudication proceedings Noticees in reply to SCN pointed out that the transaction under question was erroneously mentioned in the SCN as shares transferred from JCM HUF to JCM whereas actually JCM transferred shares to JCM HUF.\nNoticees in reply to SCN have put forth some key points viz 1. 150000 shares were inadvertently transferred on November 29 2012 from demat account of JCM to demat account of JCM HUF though the intention was to transfer the said Adjudication Order in respect of J C Mansukhani J C Mansukhani HUF JPA Solutions and Man Steel and Power Ltd now known as Man Tubinox Ltd in the matter of Man Industries India Ltd shares from demat account of JCM with ICICI Bank to another demat account of JCM with Mangal Keshav Securities.\nThe said error was made on account of having same name of JCM on both the demat accounts.\nSaid shares were transferred back to the demat account with ICICI Bank on March 2 2013.\nOwner of both the accounts i.e JCM as individual and JCM as Karta of JCM HUF is one and the same person and there was no change in aggregate holding of the PACs.\nTransaction was intended to be an interdepository transaction No as interse transfer among promoter i.e JCM and JCM HUF hence there was no requirement of disclosure.\nRegulation 134 of PIT Regulations 1992 requires a Director of a listed company to make the requisite disclosure to Stock Exchange as well as company upon change in his her shareholding in excess of 25000 shares or Rs 5 lakh in value or 1% of total shareholding of company.\nFurther Regulation 134A requires a promoter of listed company to make the disclosure to company as well as stock exchange in case of aforesaid change in shareholding.\nRegulation 135 of said regulations requires the disclosures to be made within 2 working days.\nNo to deal with the contention of the Noticees that the transfer was No deliberate it is to be observed that no such allegation has been made out in the SCN However it is undisputed and admitted fact that said transfer of shares took place from the individual demat account of JCM to demat account of JCM being Karta JCM HUF.\nIn the hearing provided to Noticees on the point of inadvertent nature of transfer it was advised to provide details of corrective action taken for inadvertent transfer of shares.\nIn this regard in the further additional submissions it is submitted that shares were received back by JCM on 02 03 2015 however it is to note that this could No be verified from the supporting demat statement provided along with said additional submissions as no such entry was found.\nFurther quarterly shareholding pattern of MIL available publicly on website of BSE shows that after increase of 152746 shares during December 2012 quarter shareholding of JCM HUF remain same at the end of quarter viz December 2012 March 2013 and June 2013 at 207350 shares and it reduced to 57500 shares at the end of September 2013 quarter.\nHence claim that 150000 shares came back to JCM in March 2013 could No be ascertained.\nEven otherwise even if for a moment the claim of the Noticee were to be accepted it is to note that the claimed transfer back is after a considerable time gap of more than four months spanning two quarters which in itself a weak argument for rectification of the error.\nWith respect to the contention that there was no effective change in aggregate shareholding of JCM and JCM HUF as PACs it is noted that provisions of regulations 134 and 134A requires the requisite disclosure to be made by Director and Promoter respectively upon certain change in their shareholding in the company.\nSuch disclosure requirements are irrespective of whether there is effective change in aggregate shareholding of promoter group or PAC and thus there are no exceptions for such eventualities under the disclosure requirements in the PIT Regulations 1992.\nAdjudication Order in respect of J C Mansukhani J C Mansukhani HUF JPA Solutions and Man Steel and Power Ltd now known as Man Tubinox Ltd in the matter of Man Industries India Ltd 17.\nWith regard to the argument that owner of both the accounts i.e JCM as individual and JCM as Karta of JCM HUF is one and the same person it is pertinent to note that identity of demat account for HUF is maintained by Karta however HUF is a separate legal entity from the individual members of the HUF.\nHence transfer of 150000 shares of MIL from JCM to JCM HUF has resulted into change in their respective shareholding in MIL which required them to make disclosure of their change in holding under Regulation 134 and 4A of PIT Regulations 1992.\nIt is noted from the records that JCM was Director and Promoter of MIL and JCM HUF was promoter of MIL on the date of said transfer of shares.\nAs per records and reply of Noticees no immediate corrective action was taken at the end of Noticee to reverse the so claimed unintended and inadvertent transfer of shares and also no belated disclosures have been filed.\nIn view of the above it is clear that JCM being director and promoter of MIL on the relevant date i.e 29 11 2012 and upon failure to make the requisite disclosure for change decrease in his holding by 150000 shares in MIL has thereby violated the provisions of Regulation 134 and 134A of PIT Regulations 1992.\nFurther JCM HUF being promoter of the MIL on the said relevant date and upon failure to make requisite disclosure for change increase in its holding by 150000 shares in MIL has thereby violated the provisions of Regulations 134A of PIT Regulations 1992.\nAlleged failure by JCM to make requisite disclosure of invocation of pledge on 11 01 2013 for 138661 shares and alleged failure to make the requisite disclosure for change in shareholding consequent to the said invocation of pledge 20.\nOn 11 01 2013 pledge was invoked on 138661 shares pledged by JCM and same also resulted in change reduction in shareholding of JCM in MIL.\nFor the above JCM being promoter of MIL was required to make the disclosure of invocation of pledge under Regulation 312 of SAST Regulations 2011 and JCM being Director and Promoter of MIL was required to make the disclosure of change in his holding under Regulation 134 and 4A of PIT Regulations 1992.\nDuring the investigation JCM claimed that he has made the required disclosures however BSE vide its email dated February 3 2015 informed SEBI that it did No receive the requisite disclosure and hence same has No been disclosed on the Exchange website.\nHence it is alleged that JCM failed to make the aforesaid requisite disclosures to Stock Exchange.\nUnder the present proceedings JCM in his reply to SCN has denied the allegations and made following key arguments in his defence viz 138661 equity shares were pledged with Aditya Birla Finance Limited which were then sold by the said lender on account of exercise of call.\nDisclosures under Regulation 134 134A read with 135 of PIT Regulations 1992 and Regulation 312 read with 313 of SAST Regulations 2011have been made to the both BSE and NSE on January 15 2013 vide fax with in the specified time limits.\nProof of completing the transmission of the disclosure is provided.\nIt is pointed out that no confirmation is sought from Adjudication Order in respect of J C Mansukhani J C Mansukhani HUF JPA Solutions and Man Steel and Power Ltd now known as Man Tubinox Ltd in the matter of Man Industries India Ltd the NSE with regards to the disclosures made by JCM even though the Company is listed on both the Exchanges and the disclosures is also to be made to both the Exchanges.\nAs regards to claim of filing of disclosure with Stock Exchanges viz BSE and NSE and in view of specific argument that confirmation for receipt of the disclosures from NSE was No sought appropriate verification of the claim was sought from BSE and NSE.\nVide separate email dated August 10 2018 sent to BSE and NSE they were provided the details of claim of JCM of making the disclosure along with the fax transmission report dated January 15 2013 and exchanges were advised to provide confirmation if they received the said fax and to provide the copy of content of the said fax.\nIn this regard following replies were received from BSE and NSE a BSE informed that it is No in receipt of the disclosure specified under 134 134A of PIT Regulations 1992 and 312 313 of SAST Regulation 2011 for dealing in 138661 shares of Man Industries Ltd for the period specified in the trailing mail.\nVide email dated 14 08 2018 BSE was specifically advised to provide copy of content received by BSE through aforesaid claimed fax sent on 15 01 2013 on urgent basis and in reply to the same BSE replied that it is No in receipt of the said fax. b In similar manner NSE also replied stating that it did No received the disclosures as claimed.\nThus both BSE and NSE have verified that the disclosures as claimed by JCM were No received by them.\nIn this scenario it is pertinent to refer to the judgment of Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal SAT in the matter of Mega Resources Ltd v.\nSEBI Appeal 49 of 2001 dated March 19 2002 wherein the Hon’ble Tribunal observed “… the regulation is No simply on sending the information it requires disclosure.\nMere dispatch of information is short of the said requirement… Thus the requirement is that the information should reach the person to whom it is meant.\nThe obligation does No end by simply posting the information in a letterbox….”.\nAs noted above by the hon’ble SAT mere sending dispatching the disclosure do No suffice the requirements and it should be appropriately received by the recipient.\nThough JCM has claimed that it made the disclosure to all the intended recipients however it has been put on record by both the Stock Exchanges that they did No received the disclosures as claimed by JCM.\nIt is pertinent to note that Stock Exchanges on receipt of disclosures under PIT and SAST Regulations immediately disclose the same on their website.\nNondisclosure is also evident from the website of BSE and NSE where the requisite disclosure under question is No available.\nThe fact remains that the disclosures claimed to have sent by JCM was No received by Stock Exchanges hence disclosure was No complete and disclosure requirements were No complied with.\nJCM was Director and Promoter of MIL on the date of invocation of pledge on his said 138661 shares and resulting change in his holding.\nGiven the above findings it is clear that there was failure to make requisite disclosure by JCM for invocation of pledge on his 138661 shares on Adjudication Order in respect of J C Mansukhani J C Mansukhani HUF JPA Solutions and Man Steel and Power Ltd now known as Man Tubinox Ltd in the matter of Man Industries India Ltd January 11 2013 to Stock Exchanges and also there was failure to make requisite disclosure to Stock Exchanges for resulting change in his shareholding from the said invocation of pledge.\nThereby JCM has violated the provisions of Regulation 312 of SAST Regulations 2011 and Regulation 134 and 4A of PIT Regulations 1992.\nAlleged failure to make requisite disclosure by JCM for change in his holding reduction upon offmarket transfer of 1100000 1.93% shares on 12 02 2013 400000 0.67% shares on 27 02 2013 and 1000000 shares on 06 04 2013 27.\nJCM undertook offmarket transfer of 1100000 1.93% shares on 12 02 2013 400000 0.67% shares on 27 02 2013 and 1000000 shares on 06 04 2013 whereby his holding was reduced in MIL.\nIt was therefore alleged that JCM being Director and Promoter of MIL was required to make the requisite disclosure for change in his holding in MIL and upon failure to do so thus allegedly violated provisions of Regulation 134 and 4A of PIT Regulations 1992.\nJCM in his reply to SCN has denied the allegations and contended that the said transactions were in the nature of pledge by way of transfer and it only effected a change of hands and No of the ownership voting rights hence no disclosure was required to be made under the provisions of Regulation 134 134A read with 135 of PIT Regulations.\nJCM further argued that he did No intend to hide the information about the offmarket transaction as the necessary disclosure was made by him under the Regulation 292 of the SAST Regulations and provided copy of the same.\nIn the hearing provided to Noticees on the point of pledge of shares it was advised to provide supporting documents viz pledge agreement etc.\nIn this regard in additional submissions to SCN no agreements for arrangement of pledge were submitted however it was submitted that total 25 lakh shares under pledge were received back by JCM on 03 10 2013 and 15 10 2013 and also indicated ledger entries claiming to have received loan and its repayment.\nIt is to note that shares claimed to have been pledged were in demat form and there are specific provisions of law for creation of pledge in a depository system viz section 12 of the Depositories Act 1956 specifically provides for pledge or hypothecation of securities held in a depository.\nFurther Regulation 58 of the SEBI Depositories and Participants Regulations 1996 provides the manner of creating pledge or hypothecation.\nIn the present case Noticee did No follow the laid down process for creation of pledge and have No even presented any agreement for the so claimed pledge arrangement.\nThus the claim of the Noticee is without merit and thus No acceptable.\nAs regards to disclosure requirements under Regulation 134 and 4A of PIT Regulations 1992 it is important to refer these provisions which are reproduced as follows 134 Any person who is a director or officer of a listed company shall disclose to the company and the stock exchange where the securities are listed in Form D the total number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights if there has been a change in such holdings of such person and his dependents as defined by the company from Adjudication Order in respect of J C Mansukhani J C Mansukhani HUF JPA Solutions and Man Steel and Power Ltd now known as Man Tubinox Ltd in the matter of Man Industries India Ltd the last disclosure made under subregulation 2 or under this sub regulation and the change exceeds Rs 5 lakh in value or 25000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower 4A Any person who is a promoter or part of promoter group of a listed company shall disclose to the company and the stock exchange where the securities are listed in Form D the total number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights if there has been a change in such holdings of such person from the last disclosure made under Listing Agreement or under subregulation 2A or under this subregulation and the change exceeds Rs 5 lakh in value or 25000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower.\nFrom the reading of above regulations it is noted that the disclosure requirements under them are triggered due to prescribed change in “shareholding” or “voting rights”.\nIt is also pertinent to note that disclosure requirement under above regulations upon change in shareholding is No dependent on the purpose of acquisition or sale of shares.\nJCM admittedly has filed disclosure under Regulation 292 of SAST Regulations 2011 for the said three transactions under question however it is pertinent to note that the disclosure for change in shareholding under Regulation 134 and 4A of PIT Regulations 1992 were No filed.\nAs per records and submissions of JCM in reply to SCN disclosure of said 3 pledge transactions under question was belatedly made on January 17 2014 i.e after over ten months of creation of so claimed pledges.\nAll this seems to be an afterthought.\nFirstly JCM has claimed that disclosure was filed on advice of consultants in the field however from the content of said disclosure letter dated January 17 2014 which is addressed to MIL it is evident that it was specifically in response to information sought by MIL.\nIt is peculiar that though JCM did No file said disclosure of change in shareholding under PIT Regulations because he was clear that same was a pledge transactions by way of transfer of shares however the disclosure of pledge itself was made with delay of 10 months that too upon queries from MIL.\nAbove indicate that JCM as an afterthought has claimed that the transfers were on account of pledge.\nGiven the above it is clear that upon offmarket transfers by JCM viz 1100000 shares on 12 02 2013 400000 shares on 27 02 2013 and 1000000 shares on 06 04 2013 there was consequent change in shareholding of JCM if No the voting rights.\nUpon failure to make the disclosure of said change in shareholding thereby JCM being Promoter and Director of MIL have violated the provisions of Regulation 134 and 4A of PIT Regulations 1992.\nAlleged failure to make requisite disclosure by JPA for change in its holding reduction upon offmarket transfer of total 13900 shares during 12 03 2013 13 03 2013 and 19 03 2013 36.\nJPA undertaken offmarket transfer of total 13900 shares during 12 03 2013 13 03 2013 and 19 03 2013 to Mangal Keshav Capital.\nDuring the investigation JCM replied that the above transfer of shares was a transfer to pool account of its broker however it was noted that Mangal Keshav Securities Ltd was the broker for JPA and Mangal Keshav Capital was No a broker for JPA.\nPursuant to the above it is alleged that upon said offmarket transfers JPA Adjudication Order in respect of J C Mansukhani J C Mansukhani HUF JPA Solutions and Man Steel and Power Ltd now known as Man Tubinox Ltd in the matter of Man Industries India Ltd being promoter of MIL incurred relevant change in its holding which required it to make requisite disclosure under Regulation 134A of PIT Regulations 1992.\nIn its reply to SCN JPA has argued that Shares were transferred to the pool account of the broker for satisfying margin requirement of the broker and future sale of shares.\nSaid transactions did No result into any change of hands or ownership therefore no disclosure was required under Regulation 134A of PIT Regulations.\nIt is also argued that the said fact can be duly verified from the broker.\nFrom the reading of Regulation 134A of PIT Regulations it is noted that the disclosure requirements under them are triggered upon change in certain change in “shareholding” or “voting rights”.\nIt is also pertinent to note that disclosure requirement under above regulations upon change in shareholding is No dependent on the purpose of acquisition or sale of shares.\nHence despite the purpose being for fulfilling margin requirement of advance transfer of shares for the purpose of intended sale of shares given the actual transfer of shares by JPA to Mangal Keshav Capital there was resultant change in shareholding of JPA.\nIt is noted from records that shares were transferred to account of Mangal Keshav Capital which is No the Stock Broker of JPA.\nIn the hearing provided to Noticees on the point of transfer of shares to pool account of broker it was contended that same was done under the instruction of broker Mangal Keshav Securities for fulfilment of margin requirement and future sale of shares by JPA.\nNoticee was advised to demonstrate evidence relating to receipt of instruction to transfer shares to particular account of Mangal Keshav Capital for fulfilling margin however same have No been provided in the additional reply.\nGiven the above it is clear that upon offmarket transfer of 13900 shares by JPA to Mangal Keshav Capital there was consequent change in shareholding of JPA.\nUpon failure to make the disclosure of said change in shareholding thereby JPA being promoter of MIL has violated the provisions of Regulation 134A of PIT Regulations 1992.\nAlleged failure to make disclosure of creation of pledge on 803204 shares pledged by MSPL 41.\nMSPL had given guarantee with power of attorney to a loan taken by JPA and the lender pledged the shares using the POA.\nFrom the documents submitted by JCM in said letter it was noted that the lender JM Financial had intimated JCM about the pledge.\nIt has been argued that viz the transaction was No contemplated in the nature of pledge of shares but in the form of providing a guarantee by one of the group company MSPL to other of its group Company JPA when JPA was in need of funds.\nMSPL has offered its shares of MIL as a collateral for the funding facility acquired by JPA from the lender J M Financial services Limited.\nWhile agreeing to act as the guarantor for JPA and providing its shares of MIL as collateral JPA had provided a power of Attorney in favor of J M in respect to these shares of MIL.\nHere it is pertinent to note that JPA had taken the loan in the year 2011.\nHowever only in the year 2013 did J M mark the pledge on the shares of MSPL.\nHere it is Adjudication Order in respect of J C Mansukhani J C Mansukhani HUF JPA Solutions and Man Steel and Power Ltd now known as Man Tubinox Ltd in the matter of Man Industries India Ltd pertinent to point out that without intimating MSPL or JPA J M upon the Power of Attorney given to them marked a pledged on the shares of MSPL.\nIt is only upon the receipt of t h e letter May 24 2013 did we come to know about the said transaction.\nJ M vide this letter intimated MSPL that the said shares were marked as pledged by it and were held by it as guarantee for the loan availed by JPA.\nIt is noted that shares were lying in account MSPL on which J M Financial created the pledge based on power of attorney which has been issued in its favour.\nThough J M Financial might have belatedly informed however it is on record and admitted fact that MSPL was informed by JM financial vide its letter dated 24 05 2013 stating that pledge has been created on 803204 shares held in demat account of MSPL viz IN30292710187975.\nAs the pledge was created based on POA issued by MSPL upon receipt of information of creation of pledge vide letter dated 24 05 2013 it was imperative for MSPL to make the disclosure about creation of pledge on its shares.\nGiven the above it is clear that despite becoming aware that pledge has been created on its 803204 shares MSPL failed to make the requisite disclosure of creation of pledge.\nThereby MSPL has violated the provision of Regulation 312 of SAST Regulations 2011.\nIssue b  If yes does the violations attract monetary penalty under Section 15Ab of the SEBI Act?\nGiven the violations established as above it is No to be determined whether the present matter is fit case for imposing monetary penalty.\nFindings in the matter makes it clear that there have been failures at the end of Noticees in making disclosures and same have violated provisions of respective regulations mentioned hereinabove.\nIt is pertinent to note that the relevant disclosures were mandatory as per the provisions of respective regulations and upon failure in making the disclosures shareholders of the company as well investors in general were devoid of information about shareholding trends of promoters director of the company.\nReliance is placed on order of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI Vs.\nShri Ram Mutual Fund [2006] 68 SCL 216SC which held that “In our considered opinion penalty is attracted as soon as the contravention of the statutory obligation as contemplated by the Act and the Regulations is established………”.\nGiven the above argument of Noticee that penalty should No be imposed is No tenable and present case is a fit case for imposing appropriate penalty upon the Noticee under Section 15Ab of SEBI Act which reads as follows 15A.\nIf any person

under Regulation 134 read with 135 of the PIT Regulations as alleged in the SCN?\nRegulation 134 of the PIT Regulations requires any person who is a director or officer of a listed company to disclose to the company and stock exchange where the securities are listed the total number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights within two working days of acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights as the case may be if there has been a change in such holdings of such person from the last disclosure made under Regulation 132 of the PIT Regulations or under

behalf of  Mr Anurag Agarwal and M s.\nPaksh Developers Pvt Ltd. stated that  Mr Anurag Agarwal was suffering from a debilitating disease affecting the nervous system and was unable to give necessary documents instructions authority to the AR for the hearing and sought a date in the first week of June 2016.\nAnother hearing was scheduled for  Mr Anurag Agarwal and M s Paksh Developers Pvt Ltd on June 8 2016 and the same was communicated to them and the AR vide Hearing Notice dated May 16 2016.\nThe AR proposed three new dates viz.\nHowever due to preoccupation of the AO one of the three said dates could No be granted.\nVide Hearing Notice dated July 7 2016 addressed to the said Noticees with a copy to the AR the Noticees were advised to appear for personal hearing on either August 5 2016 August 12 2016 or August 26 2016 with prior intimation.\nThe above Hearing Notice was also sent to the AR vide email dated July 13 2016.\nOn the scheduled date i.e  August 26 2016 the AR appeared for the personal hearing on behalf of his clients  Mr Anurag Agarwal and Paksh Developers Pvt Ltd and reiterated the submissions made in the replies dated September 28 2015 and Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited February 8 2016.\nThe AR sought time up to September 30 2016 to make additional submissions on behalf of the aforenamed Noticees inter alia in respect of alleged violations of SAST Regulations and disclosure requirement under PIT Regulations as stated in the Show Cause Notice issued to the Noticees since his client  Mr Anurag Agarwal was indisposed.\nAs no additional submissions were received from  Mr Anurag Agarwal and Paksh Developers Pvt Ltd. letter dated February 15 2017 was sent to the said Noticees along with a copy to the AR advising them to submit the relevant details latest by March 3 2017.\nSince no submissions reply were received even after lapse of considerable time letters dated August 9 2017 were again sent to  Mr Anurag Agarwal and Paksh Developers Pvt Ltd with a copy to the AR advising them to make additional submissions if any latest by August 31 2017.\nThereafter the AR vide letters dated August 28 2017 submitted that the Noticee  Mr Anurag Agarwal is on the verge of completion of compliance of Order of WTM SEBI pertaining to SAST Regulations.\nFurther Disclosure requirements under PIT regulations have been made at relevant points of time as can be seen from the Noticee’s Affidavit of February 9 2016.\nThereafter hearing was scheduled on December 15 2017 when the AR appeared and reiterated the earlier replies of theNoticees30.\nIt can be therefore seen that that sufficient opportunities of hearing have already been given to all the Noticees by the erstwhile AO.\nThereafter pursuant to the transfer of this case to the undersigned vide a hearing Notice dated March 16 2020 the Noticees were asked to attend personal hearing on March 24 2020.\nThereafter on August 28 2020 all the Noticees were provided another opportunity of hearing on September 4 2020.\nThe same was delivered by an email of even date upon the Noticees as well as through speed post.\nNo response was however received from theNoticeesSubsequently vide email dated September 9 2020 the Noticees were provided another opportunity of personal hearing on September 22 2020.\nIt was inter alia stated in the Notice that this shall be the last and final opportunity of hearing being provided to them.\nI am of the opinion that sufficient opportunities of hearing have already been given to all the Noticees as already noted in details and Tabulated in the preceding paragraphs.\nI have carefully perused the charges against the Noticees mentioned in the SCN the written & oral submissions made by them and the documents as available on record.\nThe issues that arise for consideration in the present case are a Whether the Noticees have violated Regulation 71 and Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations 1997? b Whether the Noticee No 3 has violated Regulations 131 and 4 of the PIT Regulations 1992? c Do the violations if any on the part of the Noticees attract any penalty under Sections 15Ab and 15 H of the SEBI Act 1992 respectively? d If yes what should be the quantum of penalty?\nBefore moving forward it will be appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions which read as under  Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited Relevant provisions of SAST Regulations  Acquisition of 5 per cent and more shares or voting rights of a

by SEBI in the scrip of SGWL.\nOn analysis of the shareholding pattern of the company for the quarter ended March 31 2009 it was observed that the share capital of the company was 4239688 shares out

ending on 3092009 d.\nThen Anurag Sold 500000 share in the quarter ending on 31122009.\nFurther it was observed that  Mr Hemang S Shah who was No in the list of persons holding more than 1% of the shares of the company for the quarter ended on March 31 2009 was holding 63558 shares 1.50% of the share capital in the subsequent quarter ended on June 30 2009.\nHis name did No appear in the list in the subsequent quarter ended on September 30 2009.\nWhile investigating the contraventions of the SEBI Act and relevant Regulations it was observed that as per the shareholding of persons belonging to the “Public” category and holding more than 1% of the total number of shares of the Company as per the BSE Website for the quarter ended on June 2007  Mr Anurag Agarwal who was the then MD of the company was holding 11.79% shares of the company.\nFor the quarter ended on September 2007 however it was observed that  Mr Anurag Agarwal was holding 11.79% of the share capital and Paksh in which Anurag Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited Agarwal was the Managing Director was holding 4.72% share capital of the company.\nMr Anurag Agarwal is the Managing Director of Paksh.\nAs per annual return for year ending on 3132008 filed by Paksh with ROC  Mr Anurag Agarwal was holding 829000 shares of Paksh out of total capital of Paksh i.e  830000 shares.\nThus Anurag Agarwal was holding 99.88% share capital of Paksh. b.\nAnurag Agarwal also admitted in his statement recorded on July 12 2011 that he had placed order on behalf of Paksh for transactions in the scrip of the company. c.\nFurthermore in his statement  Mr Anurag Agarwal has clearly stated that he had bought more than 15% of the shareholding in SGWL along with Paksh since he had the impression that in the future the promoters would invite him to join the promoter group.\nThus it is abundantly clear that  Mr Anurag Agarwal and Paksh were “Persons Acting in Concert” PACs as per Regulation 21e of the SAST Regulations.\nMr Anurag Agarwal and Paksh had acquired shares of the company from quarter June 2005 onwards the details of which are as under Table 2 Date Name of Entity Buy Qty.\nCombined holding of Anurag and Paksh at the end of day No of shares % of their holding to Total Share number of shares of company 4311288 Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the

16.51 39.\nMr Anurag Agarwal and his PAC Paksh acquired these shares during May 24 2005 to September 20 2007 in physical form through offmarket transactions at Rs 2.50 and Rs 8 per share respectively.\nDuring the relevant period of purchase the scrip was No having much transaction in the stock exchange.\nNo disclosures were made by Paksh and  Mr Anurag Agarwal for above acquisition of shares of the company as required under the PIT Regulations 1992 and the SAST Regulations 1997.\nMr Anurag Agarwal had also admitted in his statement dated July 12 2011 that no disclosure had been made for above transactions under SAST Regulations 1997 and or the PIT Regulations by  Mr Anurag Agarwal or Paksh.\nViolation of Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations 1997 by  Mr Anurag Agarwal and his PAC Paksh jointly on one occasion as under i. acquisition of 14% shares capital on September 20 2007 Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited 42.\nI note that Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations 1997 requires that any acquirer who acquires shares or voting rights which taken together with shares or voting rights if any held by him would entitle him to more than five per cent or ten per cent or fourteen percent or fifty four per cent shares or voting rights in a company in any manner whatsoever shall disclose at every stage the aggregate of his shareholding or voting rights in that company to the company and to the stock exchanges where shares of the target company are listed.\nFrom Table 2 above I note that on May 24 2005  Mr Anurag Agarwal bought 196800 shares amounting to 4.56% of the total paid up share capital of the Company.\nThereafter on August 18 2005  Mr Anurag Agarwal purchased a further 200000 shares of SGWL which took his total shareholding in the company to 396800 shares amounting to 9.20%.\nThus this purchase crossed the 5% threshold prescribed by Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations and hence it was required that a disclosure be made to that effect.\nHowever admittedly  Mr Anurag Agarwal has No made any disclosure in respect of the said purchase.\nThereafter on July 1 2006  Mr Anurag Agarwal again acquired shares of SGWL on this occasion the purchase being 103200 shares.\nThe said purchase combined with his previous holding meant that his holding in the company No stood at 11.79% of the total paid up capital or 500000 shares.\nSince  Mr Anurag Agarwal’s holding had crossed the prescribed threshold of 10% he was once again required to make a disclosure under Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations.\nHowever no such disclosure was made and the same was admitted by  Mr Anurag Agarwal in his statement dated July 12 2011.\nLastly on September 20 2007 Paksh acquired a further 200000 shares of SGWL.\nSince in this specific instance the shares were purchased by Paksh therefore Paksh was the acquirer and  Mr Anurag Agarwal was its PAC.\nThus subsequent to this acquisition the holding of Paksh and its PAC  Mr Anurag Agarwal rose to 700000 shares or 16.41% of the paid up capital of SGWL.\nHowever despite breaching the Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited threshold of 14% sharehoding with this acquisition the two Noticees namely Paksh and its PAC  Mr Anurag Agarwal did No make any disclosure under Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations.\nThe same has been admitted by  Mr Anurag Agarwal in his statement dated July 12 2011.\nHowever during the course of the Adjudication Proceedings Anurag Agarwal and Paksh stated that they had filed the requisite disclosures to the Company in August 2005 July 2006 and September 2007 after crossing the 5% 10% and 14% of the shareholding of SGWL.\nAnurag Agarwal and Paksh have No been able to produce any evidence to show that the requisite disclosures were filed by them to the Company and to the Stock Exchange.\nAdjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited 46.\nPaksh and  Mr Anurag Agarwal vide letter dated July 11 2011 confirmed the above mentioned transactions at Table 2 above.\nThe said transactions were also appearing in the shareholding pattern of the company available on BSE website.\nI note that Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations 1997 states that no acquirer shall acquire shares or voting rights which taken together with shares or voting rights if any held by him or by persons acting in concert with him entitle such acquirer to exercise fifteen percent or more of the voting rights in a company unless such acquirer makes a public announcement to acquire shares of such company n accordance with the Regulations.\nAs noted above  Mr Anurag Agarwal was holding 500000 shares or 11.79% of the shares of SGWL when on September 20 2007 Paksh acquired a further 200000 shares of SGWL.\nAs noted above in this specific instance the shares were purchased by Paksh therefore Paksh was the acquirer and  Mr Anurag Agarwal was its PAC.\nThus subsequent to this acquisition the holding of Paksh and its PAC  Mr Anurag Agarwal rose to 700000 shares or 16.41% of the paid up capital of SGWL.\nAdjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited 49.\nHowever I note that for the same allegation Section 11B Proceedings were also initiated by SEBI and the Learned Whole Time Member SEBI has passed an Order dated July 5 2016 in the matter.\nWhile in the current proceedings the AR has failed to make submissions despite several opportunities I note from SEBI’s Order dated July 5 2016 that the AR had made submissions in respect of the charge of violation of Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations therein.\nIn this regard  Mr Anurag Agarwal has submitted that the public offer was given in leading newspaper and submitted a copy of Public Notice published in Western Times newspaper circulated in Ahmedabad.\nIt is relevant to mention that the mandatory Public Announcement under regulation 10 read with regulation 14 of the Takeover Regulations must be made within prescribed time and in accordance with the Takeover Regulations.\nRegulation 15 provides for the requirements of public announcement of offer.\nSuch public announcement is required to be made in all editions of one English Daily with wide circulation one Hindi Daily with wide circulation and one Regional Daily with wide circulation at the place where the registered office of the target company is situated and the place of the stock exchange where the shares of the target company are most frequently traded.\nSimultaneously with such publication a copy of the public announcement should be submitted to SEBI through a registered merchant banker and should be sent to all stock exchanges and the target company for placing the same before the Board of Directors of the target company.\nRegulation 16 Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited lists the contents of the public announcement of offer.\nIn terms of regulation 181 and 182 within 14 days from the date of the public announcement the acquirer is required to file through its merchant banker with SEBI a copy of the draft letter of offer containing disclosures as specified by SEBI.\nThe letter of offer is required to be dispatched to the shareholders No earlier than 21 days from its submissions to SEBI provided that if SEBI specifies any change in the draft letter of offer the merchant banker and the acquirer have to carry out such changes before the letter of offer is dispatched to the shareholders.\nRegulation 20 deals with offer price and regulation 21 deals with minimum number of shares to be acquired in the public offer.\nRegulations 22 23 24 deals with the general obligations of the acquirer board of directors of the target company and the merchant banker respectively.\nThe public offer has to complete on acquisition of shares tendered by the shareholders in the public offer and payment of consideration to the shareholders by the acquirer within the time scheduled stipulated in the Takeover Regulations.\nIn this regard I note that vide the above mentioned SEBI’s Order dated July 05 2016 the Anurag Agarwal and Paksh were directed to make a public announcement to acquire shares of SGWL in accordance with the provisions of SEBI SAST Regulations within a period of 45 days from the date of the said order and to pay along with the applicable consideration amount interest at the rate of 10% per Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited annum from December 26 2007 to the date of payment of consideration to the shareholders who were holding shares in the target company on the date of violation and whose shares are accepted in the open offer after adjustment of dividend paid if any.\nReg. 134 Anurag Agarwal was holding 196800 or 4.56% on May 24 2005.Then he further acquired 200000 shares more than 25000 shares on August 18 2005 and did No make any disclosure.\nRegulation 131 of the PIT Regulations inter alia provides that any person who holds more than 5% shares or voting rights in any listed company shall disclose to the company the number of shares or voting rights held by such person on becoming such holder within 2 working days of the acquisition of shares or voting rights.\nAs noted above Anurag Agarwal acquired more than 5% share capital 396800 shares i.e  9.2% on August 18 2005 but did No make any disclosure.\nMr Anurag Agarwal has also admitted in his statement dated July 12 2011 that he had No made any disclosures in respect of the same.\nHence it is abundantly clear that  Mr Anurag Agarwal failed to comply with the provisions of Regulation 131 of the PIT Regulations.\nAdjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited 53.\nFurther Regulation 134 of the PIT Regulations inter alia provides that any person who is a director of a listed company shall disclose to the company and the stock exchange where the securities are listed the total number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights if there has been a change in such holdings of such person and the change exceeds Rs 5 lakh in value or 25000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower.\nHowever no such disclosure was made and the same has been admitted by  Mr Anurag Agarwal in his statement.\nIn respect of the disclosure requirements and the PIT Regulations and compliance of the same during the course of the Adjudication Proceedings in contradiction to the statement of Anurag Agarwal dated July 12 2011 the AR has stated that Anurag Agarwal had informed the Company as per Regulation 131 and 134 of the PIT Regulations.\nCopies of the purported disclosures are also attached to the replies of Anuarg Agarwal dated September 28 2015.\nHowever surprisingly on

ending on 3092009 d.\nThen Anurag Sold 500000 share in the quarter ending on 31122009.\nFurther it was observed that  Mr Hemang S Shah who was No in the list of persons holding more than 1% of the shares of the company for the quarter ended on March 31 2009 was holding 63558 shares 1.50% of the share capital in the subsequent quarter ended on June 30 2009.\nHis name did No appear in the list in the subsequent quarter ended on September 30 2009.\nWhile investigating the contraventions of the SEBI Act and relevant Regulations it was observed that as per the shareholding of persons belonging to the “Public” category and holding more than 1% of the total number of shares of the Company as per the BSE Website for the quarter ended on June 2007  Mr Anurag Agarwal who was the then MD of the company was holding 11.79% shares of the company.\nFor the quarter ended on September 2007 however it was observed that  Mr Anurag Agarwal was holding 11.79% of the share capital and Paksh in which Anurag Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited Agarwal was the Managing Director was holding 4.72% share capital of the company.\nMr Anurag Agarwal is the Managing Director of Paksh.\nAs per annual return for year ending on 3132008 filed by Paksh with ROC  Mr Anurag Agarwal was holding 829000 shares of Paksh out of total capital of Paksh i.e  830000 shares.\nThus Anurag Agarwal was holding 99.88% share capital of Paksh. b.\nAnurag Agarwal also admitted in his statement recorded on July 12 2011 that he had placed order on behalf of Paksh for transactions in the scrip of the company. c.\nFurthermore in his statement  Mr Anurag Agarwal has clearly stated that he had bought more than 15% of the shareholding in SGWL along with Paksh since he had the impression that in the future the promoters would invite him to join the promoter group.\nThus it is abundantly clear that  Mr Anurag Agarwal and Paksh were “Persons Acting in Concert” PACs as per Regulation 21e of the SAST Regulations.\nMr Anurag Agarwal and Paksh had acquired shares of the company from quarter June 2005 onwards the details of which are as under Table 2 Date Name of Entity Buy Qty.\nCombined holding of Anurag and Paksh at the end of day No of shares % of their holding to Total Share number of shares of company 4311288 Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the

16.51 39.\nMr Anurag Agarwal and his PAC Paksh acquired these shares during May 24 2005 to September 20 2007 in physical form through offmarket transactions at Rs 2.50 and Rs 8 per share respectively.\nDuring the relevant period of purchase the scrip was No having much transaction in the stock exchange.\nNo disclosures were made by Paksh and  Mr Anurag Agarwal for above acquisition of shares of the company as required under the PIT Regulations 1992 and the SAST Regulations 1997.\nMr Anurag Agarwal had also admitted in his statement dated July 12 2011 that no disclosure had been made for above transactions under SAST Regulations 1997 and or the PIT Regulations by  Mr Anurag Agarwal or Paksh.\nViolation of Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations 1997 by  Mr Anurag Agarwal and his PAC Paksh jointly on one occasion as under i. acquisition of 14% shares capital on September 20 2007 Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited 42.\nI note that Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations 1997 requires that any acquirer who acquires shares or voting rights which taken together with shares or voting rights if any held by him would entitle him to more than five per cent or ten per cent or fourteen percent or fifty four per cent shares or voting rights in a company in any manner whatsoever shall disclose at every stage the aggregate of his shareholding or voting rights in that company to the company and to the stock exchanges where shares of the target company are listed.\nFrom Table 2 above I note that on May 24 2005  Mr Anurag Agarwal bought 196800 shares amounting to 4.56% of the total paid up share capital of the Company.\nThereafter on August 18 2005  Mr Anurag Agarwal purchased a further 200000 shares of SGWL which took his total shareholding in the company to 396800 shares amounting to 9.20%.\nThus this purchase crossed the 5% threshold prescribed by Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations and hence it was required that a disclosure be made to that effect.\nHowever admittedly  Mr Anurag Agarwal has No made any disclosure in respect of the said purchase.\nThereafter on July 1 2006  Mr Anurag Agarwal again acquired shares of SGWL on this occasion the purchase being 103200 shares.\nThe said purchase combined with his previous holding meant that his holding in the company No stood at 11.79% of the total paid up capital or 500000 shares.\nSince  Mr Anurag Agarwal’s holding had crossed the prescribed threshold of 10% he was once again required to make a disclosure under Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations.\nHowever no such disclosure was made and the same was admitted by  Mr Anurag Agarwal in his statement dated July 12 2011.\nLastly on September 20 2007 Paksh acquired a further 200000 shares of SGWL.\nSince in this specific instance the shares were purchased by Paksh therefore Paksh was the acquirer and  Mr Anurag Agarwal was its PAC.\nThus subsequent to this acquisition the holding of Paksh and its PAC  Mr Anurag Agarwal rose to 700000 shares or 16.41% of the paid up capital of SGWL.\nHowever despite breaching the Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited threshold of 14% sharehoding with this acquisition the two Noticees namely Paksh and its PAC  Mr Anurag Agarwal did No make any disclosure under Regulation 71 of the SAST Regulations.\nThe same has been admitted by  Mr Anurag Agarwal in his statement dated July 12 2011.\nHowever during the course of the Adjudication Proceedings Anurag Agarwal and Paksh stated that they had filed the requisite disclosures to the Company in August 2005 July 2006 and September 2007 after crossing the 5% 10% and 14% of the shareholding of SGWL.\nAnurag Agarwal and Paksh have No been able to produce any evidence to show that the requisite disclosures were filed by them to the Company and to the Stock Exchange.\nAdjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited 46.\nPaksh and  Mr Anurag Agarwal vide letter dated July 11 2011 confirmed the above mentioned transactions at Table 2 above.\nThe said transactions were also appearing in the shareholding pattern of the company available on BSE website.\nI note that Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations 1997 states that no acquirer shall acquire shares or voting rights which taken together with shares or voting rights if any held by him or by persons acting in concert with him entitle such acquirer to exercise fifteen percent or more of the voting rights in a company unless such acquirer makes a public announcement to acquire shares of such company n accordance with the Regulations.\nAs noted above  Mr Anurag Agarwal was holding 500000 shares or 11.79% of the shares of SGWL when on September 20 2007 Paksh acquired a further 200000 shares of SGWL.\nAs noted above in this specific instance the shares were purchased by Paksh therefore Paksh was the acquirer and  Mr Anurag Agarwal was its PAC.\nThus subsequent to this acquisition the holding of Paksh and its PAC  Mr Anurag Agarwal rose to 700000 shares or 16.41% of the paid up capital of SGWL.\nAdjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited 49.\nHowever I note that for the same allegation Section 11B Proceedings were also initiated by SEBI and the Learned Whole Time Member SEBI has passed an Order dated July 5 2016 in the matter.\nWhile in the current proceedings the AR has failed to make submissions despite several opportunities I note from SEBI’s Order dated July 5 2016 that the AR had made submissions in respect of the charge of violation of Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations therein.\nIn this regard  Mr Anurag Agarwal has submitted that the public offer was given in leading newspaper and submitted a copy of Public Notice published in Western Times newspaper circulated in Ahmedabad.\nIt is relevant to mention that the mandatory Public Announcement under regulation 10 read with regulation 14 of the Takeover Regulations must be made within prescribed time and in accordance with the Takeover Regulations.\nRegulation 15 provides for the requirements of public announcement of offer.\nSuch public announcement is required to be made in all editions of one English Daily with wide circulation one Hindi Daily with wide circulation and one Regional Daily with wide circulation at the place where the registered office of the target company is situated and the place of the stock exchange where the shares of the target company are most frequently traded.\nSimultaneously with such publication a copy of the public announcement should be submitted to SEBI through a registered merchant banker and should be sent to all stock exchanges and the target company for placing the same before the Board of Directors of the target company.\nRegulation 16 Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited lists the contents of the public announcement of offer.\nIn terms of regulation 181 and 182 within 14 days from the date of the public announcement the acquirer is required to file through its merchant banker with SEBI a copy of the draft letter of offer containing disclosures as specified by SEBI.\nThe letter of offer is required to be dispatched to the shareholders No earlier than 21 days from its submissions to SEBI provided that if SEBI specifies any change in the draft letter of offer the merchant banker and the acquirer have to carry out such changes before the letter of offer is dispatched to the shareholders.\nRegulation 20 deals with offer price and regulation 21 deals with minimum number of shares to be acquired in the public offer.\nRegulations 22 23 24 deals with the general obligations of the acquirer board of directors of the target company and the merchant banker respectively.\nThe public offer has to complete on acquisition of shares tendered by the shareholders in the public offer and payment of consideration to the shareholders by the acquirer within the time scheduled stipulated in the Takeover Regulations.\nIn this regard I note that vide the above mentioned SEBI’s Order dated July 05 2016 the Anurag Agarwal and Paksh were directed to make a public announcement to acquire shares of SGWL in accordance with the provisions of SEBI SAST Regulations within a period of 45 days from the date of the said order and to pay along with the applicable consideration amount interest at the rate of 10% per Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited annum from December 26 2007 to the date of payment of consideration to the shareholders who were holding shares in the target company on the date of violation and whose shares are accepted in the open offer after adjustment of dividend paid if any.\nReg. 134 Anurag Agarwal was holding 196800 or 4.56% on May 24 2005.Then he further acquired 200000 shares more than 25000 shares on August 18 2005 and did No make any disclosure.\nRegulation 131 of the PIT Regulations inter alia provides that any person who holds more than 5% shares or voting rights in any listed company shall disclose to the company the number of shares or voting rights held by such person on becoming such holder within 2 working days of the acquisition of shares or voting rights.\nAs noted above Anurag Agarwal acquired more than 5% share capital 396800 shares i.e  9.2% on August 18 2005 but did No make any disclosure.\nMr Anurag Agarwal has also admitted in his statement dated July 12 2011 that he had No made any disclosures in respect of the same.\nHence it is abundantly clear that  Mr Anurag Agarwal failed to comply with the provisions of Regulation 131 of the PIT Regulations.\nAdjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited 53.\nFurther Regulation 134 of the PIT Regulations inter alia provides that any person who is a director of a listed company shall disclose to the company and the stock exchange where the securities are listed the total number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights if there has been a change in such holdings of such person and the change exceeds Rs 5 lakh in value or 25000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower.\nHowever no such disclosure was made and the same has been admitted by  Mr Anurag Agarwal in his statement.\nIn respect of the disclosure requirements and the PIT Regulations and compliance of the same during the course of the Adjudication Proceedings in contradiction to the statement of Anurag Agarwal dated July 12 2011 the AR has stated that Anurag Agarwal had informed the Company as per Regulation 131 and 134 of the PIT Regulations.\nCopies of the purported disclosures are also attached to the replies of Anuarg Agarwal dated September 28 2015.\nHowever surprisingly on perusal of the attachments submitted it is seen that same relate to sale of shares by Anurag Agarwal in 2009.\nIn fact in his statement dated July 12 2011 also Anurag Agarwal had clearly stated that he had No made any disclosures at the time of purchase of the shares but had made the disclosures upon sale of shares.\nAdjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited 56.\nIn light of the above paras the Noticees are liable for imposition of monetary penalties under sections 15Ab and 15H of the SEBI Act 1992 respectively which reads as under 15A.\nPenalty

Limited 58.\nWhile determining the quantum of penalties under section 15Ab 15H and 15HA of the SEBI Act1992 it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of the SEBI Act1992 which reads as under 15J.\nWhile adjudging quantum of penalty under [15I or section 11 or section 11B the Board or the adjudicating officer] shall have due regard to the following factors namely — a the

c the repetitive nature of the default.\nThe SAST Regulations mandates an acquirer to make a public announcement if the acquirer acquires 15% or more of the voting rights in a company.\nBy failing to make the public announcement with respect to the said acquisition the investors and the shareholders at large were Adjudication order in respect of 2 entities in the matter of Sterling Greenwoods Limited denied of the opportunity to exit from the company.\nIn view of the above after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and exercising the powers conferred upon me under

under Definitions.\n1 In these regulations unless the context otherwise requires the following words expressions and derivations therefrom shall have the meanings assigned to them as under– …… n unpublished price sensitive information means any information relating to a company or its securities directly or indirectly that is No generally available which upon becoming generally available is likely to materially affect the price of the securities and shall ordinarily including but No restricted to information relating to the following – i financial results;\n……… NOTE It is intended that

unpublished price sensitive information.\nIn the present case the financial result for quarter ending June 30 2015 was declared on July 10 2015 thus the period from July 01 2015 to July 10 2015 was unpublished i.e  till the time it was disclosed by the company on exchange platform.\nHence it is concluded that there was in existence an unpublished price sensitive information during the investigation period and declaration of financial result of a company is UPSI.\nIt is noted that after the announcement i.e  between July 10 2015 and July 23 2015 the scrip fell down from Rs18.75 to Rs 14.55 i.e  It registered a fall of 22% in 9 trading days.\nIt was stated in the SCN that the total income as well as the net profit of the company has gone up from 201213 to 201415.\nFurther

Rs 3.87 crore.\nThus I find that funds contributed by Burlington Rs 24000000 and Amrit Rs 7350000 for acquiring the redeemable preference shares of the company at a premium of Rs 90 per share constituted 80% of the networth of the company.\nHowever subsequently the financial position of the company deteriorated to such an extent that as per the Annual Report of FY 201011 I find that the company had accumulated losses which were more than 100% of the networth of the company.\nAt this stage I find from the Annual Report of the company for FY 201011 that the company took interest free loan of Rs 32500000 out of business expediency from Obident and gave interest free loan out of business expediency to Burlington and Amrit.\nBurlington Finance Pvt Ltd 24000000 2 M s.\nAmrit Sales Promotion Pvt Ltd 7350000 Total 31350000 59.\nI find it pertinent to mention here that Auditor’s Report for FY 201011 had also highlighted the fact that interest free loans given by the company were prejudicial to the interest of the company.\nSubsequently as per the Annual Report of the company for FY 201112 I find that the company redeemed 313500 redeemable preference shares of Rs 10 each at premium of Rs 90 each issued to Burlington and Amrit.\nThe Auditors Report of Obident for the year ended March 30 2011 downloaded from MCA website showed Rs 3.25 crore given and repaid during the year as loan transaction done with related parties associate concern.\nFurther the Annual Report of the Company for FY 201112 at Note 5 to ‘Notes to Financial Statements’ shows an amount of Rs 9231 payable to Elan Capital Advisors i.e  earlier Obident.\nThe Noticee subsequently sold the company to  Mr Chandu Chavan & Ors.\nI find here that the Noticee has stated that immediately post their acquisition there was no change in the Board of Directors or in the auditors of the Company.\nAlso the signed copy of the minutes of the Board meeting approving the issue of 240000 redeemable Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nInnoventive Venture Limited preference shares at a premium of Rs 90 per share to Burlington and 73500 redeemable preference shares at a premium of Rs 90 per share to Amrit has No been provided by the Company.\nFurther I note that the Noticee has stated that there was no agreement in respect of the 30000 shares 4.08% purchased by it from  Mr Hanuman Mal Anchalia HUF by way of offmarket transaction that resulted in alleged violation of Regulation 12 read with Regulation 143 of the Takeover Regulations 1997.\nI find from the Annual Report of the Company for FY 200506 that the company had accumulated losses at March 31 2006 which were more than 50% of the networth of the Company.\nUpon Noticee being named as the sole promoter pursuant to its acquisition of shares it is however observed that the company started considering various action plans and initiated talks for potential profitable businesses for its revival.\nIt is further observed that pursuant to the Noticee acquiring 4.08% shares and becoming the sole promoter of the company the business object of the company went through a major change whereby the NBFC business was closed down and company started looking for lucrative opportunities in petroleum and exploration business.\nFurther by March 30 2008 the entire earlier Board of Directors resigned.\nHe was also appointed as a Member of the Audit Committee and on the Shareholders Investors’ Grievance Committee.\nFurther on the day the director of the Noticee who was appointed director in the Company resigned i.e  on June 30 2009 on the very same day the promoter director of the Noticee was appointed on the Board of Directors of the Company and was further made the Chairman of the Audit Committee and of the Shareholders Investors’ Grievance Committee.\nAnd at such point of time I find that the promoter director of the Noticee was the Director of the Company as also the Chairman of the Audit Committee & Shareholders Investor Grievance Committee.\nThe Company stated that fresh equity was raised during 201112 to the extent of Rs 14.42 crore Rs 10.42 crore by way of Swap and Rs 4.00 crore in cash and equity raised in cash was used for repayment of loan of Rs 32500000  raised from Obident in the interim.\nThough the Company stated that bank statements supporting the same would be made available in due course of time however the same have No been provided.\nI also note here that the Bhagwati Committee which was constituted to review the SEBI Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations 1994 had recommended a broad definition of control and opined that it should be left to SEBI to decide whether there has been an acquisition of control on the basis of facts of each case.\nI note Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nInnoventive Venture Limited further that the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee TRAC in its report dated July 19 2010 had also reiterated the above views of the Bhagwati Committee.\nIn view of the foregoing I am convinced that it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under Section 15Hii of the SEBI Act for the violation of Regulation 12 read with 14 of the Takeover Regulations 1997 against the Noticee which reads as under Penalty for nondisclosure of acquisition of shares and takeovers.\nIf any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder fails to— i ………. ii make a public announcement to acquire shares at a minimum price; or iii ……… iv ………… he shall be liable to a penalty of twentyfive crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of such failure whichever is higher.\nWhile determining the quantum of monetary penalty under Section 15Hii of the SEBI Act I have considered the factors stipulated in Section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under Adjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nWhile adjudging quantum of penalty under Section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nInnoventive Venture Limited 78.\nAs per Section 15Hii of the SEBI Act the Noticee is liable to a penalty of twentyfive crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of such failure whichever is higher.\nI have taken note of the fact put forth by the Noticee that as per Letter of Offer dated December 03 2011 filed by the buyers taking the date of March 31 2006 as the trigger date and adding interest @10% p.a. the offer price would have become Rs 8.62 per share only which is far lower than the offer price of Rs 10 per share which the buyers had offered in 2011.\nHowever I find it pertinent to mention here that the shareholders are entitled to receive interest for the delay involved in receiving the payment of the consideration amount for the period from the date on which it was due till the date on which the actual payment is made.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nInnoventive Venture Limited 82.\nIn order to ascertain the loss caused if any to the shareholders who would have sold shares pursuant to acquisition of shares in the Company by the Noticee on March 2006 and prior to the public announcement made by the Acquirer  Mr Chandu Chavan & Ors. the Company and its present Registrars were advised to provide such details along with the quantum and price at which the shares were sold.\nHowever despite issue of summons to the Company and the present Registrars the said details were No forthcoming from the Company.\nPublic announcement as envisaged under Regulation 12 read with Regulation 14 of the Takeover Regulations 1997 is the announcement of the open offer by the acquirers and the persons acting in concert primarily disclosing their intention to acquire shares of the target company from the existing shareholders thereby giving an opportunity of exit to the public shareholders at a specified price during a specified time.\nIn fact I find that the penalty provision under Section 15H ii of the SEBI Act also specifically refers to failure to “make a public announcement to acquire shares at a minimum price”.\nAnd I find that there were about 30 shareholders holding 705000 shares 95.92% out of the total of 735000 shares of the Company who were denied an exit option by the Noticee by failing to make an open offer at the relevant point of time.\nAfter taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case I impose a penalty of Rs 5000000  Rupees Fifty Lakhs only on the Noticee viz.\nAdjudication Order in the matter of M s.\nInnoventive Venture Limited 85.\nThe Noticee shall remit pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order either by way of

Department SEBI.\nThe Format for forwarding details confirmations of epayments made to SEBI shall be in the form as provided at Annexure A of Press Release No 131 2016 dated August 09 2016 shown at

September 29 2017 Anita Kenkare Place Mumbai Adjudicating Officer", "2[Explanation.—For the removal of doubts it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of
